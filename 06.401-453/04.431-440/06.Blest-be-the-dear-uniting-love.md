####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. B lf.st be the dear uniting love 
That will not let us part:
Our bodies may far off remove ;
We still are one in heart.

2. Join’d in one Spirit to our Head
We wait His truth to know,
That we may in His footsteps tread, 
And do His work below.

3. O, let us ever walk with Him,
And nothing know beside;
Nothing desire, nothing esteem,
But Jesus crucify’d.

4. Then let us hasten to the day,
Which shall our Lord restore 
When death and sin shall pass away, 
And we shall part no more.
