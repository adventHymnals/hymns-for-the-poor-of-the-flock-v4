1. O God, Thy bounteous hand hath spread
With earthly food our humble board, 
And feeds our souls with sweeter bread, 
The Bread of life—our gracious Lord.

2. Thy grace in all things soars above
The sweetest song Thy saints can raise, 
Yet, Lord, for this, and all Thy love 
Accept our weak, unworthy praise.
