1. I n fellowship we meet around
The table of our Lord;
Let joy and thankfulness abound,
For faithful is His word.

2. The people whom the Lord appoints
The heirs of glory here;
He saves, and by His grace anoints,
And bids them nothing fear.

3. The food they eat is meat indeed,
The richest heav’n affords;
The bread of God is living bread,
His words are living words.

4. Then let our thankful songs abound,
Our privilege is great;
Our Father’s table we surround,
And eat of children’s meat.
