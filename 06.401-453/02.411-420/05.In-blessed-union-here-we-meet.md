####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. In blessed union here we meet,
We sit at the Redeemer’s feet,
And eat the bread of heav’n ;
How highly privileg’d are ive,
And O how thankful should we be,
To whom this grace is giv’n !

2. To join in fellowship, how sweet,
With those who in the Saviour meet,
Enlighten’d from above!
How excellent the pleasure is,
That flows from such a feast as this,
Where all are join’d in love.

3. But if such joy is found to flow 
From sacred fellowship below,
Then what must heaven be ?
Where all the Saviour’s friends shall meet, 
And dwell in happiness complete, 
Throughout eternity.
