1. O b e d i e n t  to our d y i n g  Lord,
Who bid us thus remember Him,
O let us now surround His board,
His flesh our food, His love our theme.

2. Sweet fefist! here love and union reign,
An earnest of the joys above ;
And, meanest of the Saviour’s train,
We celebrate His dying love.

3. O may that love, by pow’r divine,
To all our hearts be now made known; 
Dear Saviour, on Thy people shine,
The people Thou hast made Thine own.
