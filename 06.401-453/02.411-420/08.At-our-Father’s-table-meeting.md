1. At our Father’s table meeting,
All our sins by Him forgiv n ;42
l o r d ’ s  s u p p e r .
Children’s bread together eating,
Bread that cometh down from heav’n 
Let us banish
Hence the old unhallow’d leav’n.

2. Blessed is the name we think of,
When together breaking bread; 
Blessed is the cup we drink of,
Type of blood, for sinners shed: 
Happy are we,
Quicken’d by the Lord, and fed.

3. Let us walk in love, united
To our living Head above,
Let us sing His praise delighted,
Sing the praise of Him we love: 
Saviour, bless us!
Let us all Thy goodness prove.

4. Standing in the Saviour’s merit,
We have peace, and we are blest; 
Taught and guided by the Spirit,
We have hope of future rest:
This we wait for,
And the Saviour’s time is best.
