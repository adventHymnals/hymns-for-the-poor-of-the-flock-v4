1. Our Saviour’s death is here display’d.
The death endur’d for us;
On Jesus all our sin was laid,
He bore it on His cross.

2. And now in heav’n His people’s names
Upon His breast appear ;
For them eternal life He claims.
Whose sin He cancell’d here.lord's s u p p e r .

3. We hope with all the ransom’d crowd 
Ere long to see His face ;
To testify our joy aloud,
In songs of endless praise.
