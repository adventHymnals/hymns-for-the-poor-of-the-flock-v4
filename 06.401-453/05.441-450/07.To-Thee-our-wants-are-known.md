```txt
1. To Thee our wants are known,
From Thee are all our powers, 
Accept what is Thine own,
And pardon what is ou rs;
Our praises, Lord, and prayers receive, 
And to Thy word Thy blessing give.

2. 0 grant that each of us,
Now met before Thee here,
May meet together thus,
When Thou and Thine appear;
And follow Thee to heav’n our home, 
E’en so, Amen, Lord Jesus, come.
