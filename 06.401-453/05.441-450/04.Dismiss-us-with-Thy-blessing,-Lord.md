####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. D ismiss us with Thy blessing, Lord ; 
Help us to feed upon Thy word;
All that has been amiss forgive,
And let Thy truth within us live!

2. Though we are guilty, Thou art good; 
Wash all our works in Jesu’s blood; 
Give ev’ry fetter’d'soul release,
And bid us all, “ Depart in peace! ”
