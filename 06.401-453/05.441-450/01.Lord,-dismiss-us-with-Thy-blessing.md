## 064. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing; 
Fill our hearts with joy and peace; 
Let us each, Thy love possessing, 
Triumph in redeeming grace !
O refresh us,
Trav’lling through this wilderness.
PARTING. 65, 66

2. Thanks we give, and adoration,
For the Gospel’s joyful sound.
May the fruits of Thy salvation 
In our hearts and lives abound! 
Ever faithful
To the truth may we be found !

3. So, whene’er the signal’s given,
Us from earth to call away,
Borne aloft by grace to heaven,
Glad the summons to obey,
We shall ever
Reign with Thee in endless day!
