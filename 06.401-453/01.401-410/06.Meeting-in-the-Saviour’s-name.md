1. M eet ing in the Saviour’s name,
“ Breaking bread” by His command, 
To the world we thus proclaim,
On what ground we hope to stand, 
When the Lord shall come with clouds, 
Join’d by heaven’s exulting crowds.

2. From the cross our hope we draw,
’Tis the sinner’s sure resource;
Jesus magnified the law,
Jesus borer its awful curse:
What a joyful truth is this!
0  how full o f hope it is !

3. Jesus died, and then arose—
Yes, He rose, He lives, He reigns; 
Jesus vanquish’d all His foes,
Jesus led them all in chains:
His the triumph and the crown,
His the glory and renown.

4. Sing we then of Him Who died;
Sing of Him Who rose again;
By His blood we’re justified,
And with Him we hope to reign; 
Yes, we hope to see our Lord,
And to share His bright reward.
