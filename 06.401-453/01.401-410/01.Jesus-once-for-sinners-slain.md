####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. Jesus, once for sinners slain,
From the dead was raised again;
And in heav’n is now set down,
Glorious on His Father’s throne.

2. He has made an end of sin,
And His blood has wash’d us clean;
In our midst, assembled here,
Jesus stands His saints to cheer.

3. While we break the bread in faith,
We shew forth our Saviour’s death;
Bread thus broken aptly shews 
How His body God did bruise.

4. While by faith we drink the wine,
Of His blood we see the sign;
Precious blood ! so freely spilt,
To redeem our souls from guilt.

5. Lord, we thus remember Thee;
But we long Thy face to see—
Long to reach our heat’nly home.
“ Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!”
