1. B re t h r e n , come, our Saviour bids us—
Bids us to a feast of love:
Bless the Lord, Whose bounty feeds us 
With .provision from above:
Ye, for whom His life was given,
" Come and eat the bread of heaven.

2. Let us think of Him who bought u s ;
’Tis the Saviour’s own command: 
When we wander’d, Jesus sought us ;
Now He leads us by the hand—
Now He gives us hope, and says,
We shall sing His endless praise.

3. O how much His people owe Him !
O what love our Lord has shewn !
Well may we surrender to Him 
All that once we call’d our own.
Lord, we give ourselves to Thee—
Thou our Guide, our Master be !2 8,2 9
