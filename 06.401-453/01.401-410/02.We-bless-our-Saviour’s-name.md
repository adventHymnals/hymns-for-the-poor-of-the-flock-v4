####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. We bless our Saviour’s name,
Our sins are all forgiven;
To suffer once to earth He came:
He now is crown’d in heaven.

2. His precious blood was shed,
His body bruis’d for sin; 
Remembering this, we break the bread, 
And joyful drink the wine.

3. While we remember Thee,
Lord, in our midst appear;
Let each by faith Thy body see,
While we assemble here.

4. We never would forget
Thy rich, Thy precious love;
Our theme of joy and wonder here,
Our endless song above.

5. O let Thy love constrain
Our souls to cleave to Thee 1 
And ever in our hearts remain 
That word, Remember me.
