1. See ! the Saviour spreads a table,
And invites His friends to eat: 
Surely none but He is able 
To supply so rich a treat:
’Tis His body:
Brethren, this indeed is meat.

2. Come, and round His board assemble;
Jesus bids you now draw near:
Ye who hear His word and tremble, 
Banish every servile fear:
Come and witness 
That the Lord Himself is here.

3. Gracious Master! bless our meeting; 
Grant us spiritual food,
While the world is still repeating,
“ Who will shew us any good?”
On Thy people
Shine from heaven Thy bright abode.
