```txt
1. Our passover is offer’d up,
The bread we break His body is;
His blood was shed to fill the cup,
And 0 was ever love like His !

2. The Master of the feast has said,
Be sure all leaven to remove;
And keep it with th’ unleaven’d bread 
Of truth, sincerity, and love.

3. May we obey, and sweetly prove
How blest they are who know His name; 
And share at length, with those above,
The wedding supper of the Lamb.
