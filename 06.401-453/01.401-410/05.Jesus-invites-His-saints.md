####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. J esus invites His saints
To meet around His board ;
Here pardon’d sinners sit and hold 
Communion with their Lord.

2. Our heav’nly Father calls
Christ and His members o ne;
We the young children of His love,
And He the first-born Son.

3.  We are but sev’ral parts
Of the same broken bread;
'Our body hath its sev’ral limbs,
But Jesus is the Head.

4.  Let all our pow’rs be join’d,
His glorious name to raise;
Pleasure and love fill every mind,
And ev’ry voice be praise.
