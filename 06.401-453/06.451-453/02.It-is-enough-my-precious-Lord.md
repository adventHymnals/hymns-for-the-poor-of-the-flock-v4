####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. It is enough—my precious Lord,
Thy tender sympathy—
My ev’ry sin and sorrow can 
Devolve itself on Thee.

2. As God, Thou graspedst e’en the whole
Of human misery,
Thine own alone lay desolate,
That Thou mightst pitied be.p r a y e r .

3. Thy risen life but whets Thee more
For kindly sympathy,
Thy love unhinder’d rests upon 
Each bruised “ Branch in Thee.”

4. Jesus, Thou hast avail’d to probe
My deepest malady,
It freely flows, more freely finds 
Thy gracious remedy.
