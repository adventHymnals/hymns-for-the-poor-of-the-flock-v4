1. Lord ! let my heart still turn to Thee,
In all my hours of waking thought!
Nor let this heart e’er wish to flee,
To think, or feel, where thou art not!

2. In every hour of pain or woe,
When nought on earth this heart can cheer, 
When sighs will burst, and tears will flow,
Lord, hush the sigh, and chase the tear!

3. In every dream of earthly bliss,
Do Thou, dear Saviour, present be!
Nor let me dream of happiness 
On earth, without the thought of Thee!

4. To my last lingering thought at night,
Do Thou, Lord Jesus, still be near,
And ere the dawn of opening light,
In still small accents wake mine ear!

5. Whene’er I read Thy sacred word,
Bright on the page in glory shine!
And let me say, *“This precious Lord 
In all His full salvation's mine.”*

6. And ==when before the throne I kneel==,
Hear from that throne of grace my prayer; 
And let each hope of heaven I feel,
Burn with the thought to meet Thee there.

7. Thus teach me, Lord, to look to Thee,
In ev’ry hour of waking thought,
Nor let me ever wish to be,
To think or feel where Thou art not! AMEN.
