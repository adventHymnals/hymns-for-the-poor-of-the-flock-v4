## 048. With Jesus in our midst
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. With Jesus in our midst
We gather round the board; 
Though many, we are one in Christ, 
One body in the Lord.

2. Our sins were laid on Him
When bruis’d on Calvary;
With Christ we died and rose again, 
And sit with Him on high.

3. Faith eats the bread of life,
And drinks the living wine; 
Thus we in love together knit,
On Jesus’ breast recline.

4.  Soon shall the night be gone,
And we with Jesus reign;
The marriage supper of the Lamb 
Shall banish ev’ry pain.
