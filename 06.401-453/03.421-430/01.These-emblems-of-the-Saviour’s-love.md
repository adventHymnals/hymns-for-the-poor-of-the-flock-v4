1. T he s e  emblems of th e Saviour’s love,
By faith may we receive;
And with a solemn pleasure prove,
That we in Him believe.

2. No goodness of our own we bring;
For we are vile and base;
Christ is our all, of Christ we sing,
And wait to see His face.

3. As beggars poor, and blind, and mean,
We rest on Christ alone:
Thanks to the Lamb that once was slain— 
The Lamb that did atone.

4. Our sins are His (O bless His name!)
His righteousness is our’s ;
He saves from Satan, wrath, and sin,
And all their frightful powers.

5. Then let us each, with heart and tongue,
Sing, “ Worthy is the Lamb !”
To Him alone the praise belongs,
And we ’ll adore His name.
