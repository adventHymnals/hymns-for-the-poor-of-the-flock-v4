        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 046. Simply as disciples gather’d. “ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the  communion (lit. fellowship) of the blood of Christ ?  The bread which we break, is it not the communion  (lit. fellowship) of the body of Christ? For we,being many, are one bread, and one body; for we all are  partakers of that one bread.”

“ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the 
communion (lit. fellowship) of the blood of Christ ? 
The bread which we break, is it not the communion 
(lit. fellowship) of the body of Christ? For we,being many, are one bread, and one body; for we all are 
partakers of that one bread.”

1. Sim p l y as disciples ga th er’d
In His name—The Lord is here;
And in Him our all is treasur’d,
Him we all in common share.

2. Not to teach or hear assembling,
But to do our Master’s will;
Thus to Jesu’s self resembling,
God Himself shall cheer us still.

3. Yea, this table of communion,
Whither by the Lord we ’re led,
Sweetly speaks our blessed union,
One the body—one the bread.

4.  And as gather’d round the table,
We the wine together sup,
We have joy, both sure and stable,
One the blessing—one the cup.

5. In the Spirit one for ever,
One with Christ, and one with God;
One we are, and nought can sever 
Us who are redeem’d with blood.

6. By our sins His blood was spilled.
Pardon hence through love Divine!
And, through Him the law fulfilled,
In His righteousness we shine.

7. Till He comes we still are thinking ^
That “ we wait for Him to come,”
And (with us the new wine drinking)
Take us to His royal home.
