####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. F ob us Jesus was b a p tiz ’d 
For us He was ag on iz’d ;
Mighty vengeance, like a flood, 
Overwhelm’d the Lamb of God.

2. Come, ye saints, with wonder view 
What the Lord has done for you;
View the mighty waters roll,
Breaking in upon His soul.

3. View the swelling floods of wrath 
Sinking Jesus into death;
Grief Him cover’d like a grave,
When He died your souls to save.

4. This was baptism indeed;
Well might mountains shake with dread; 
Baptism serves in type to show,
What our Lord did undergo.5 Sons of God, lift up your eyes; 
See the martyr’d Saviour rise;
He has conquer’d death and hell; 
With Him you shall ever dwell.
