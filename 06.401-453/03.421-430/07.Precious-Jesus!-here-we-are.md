####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. P recious Jesus! here we are 
Come to witness and declare
We are Thine, redeem’d with blood,
Call’d and prov’d the sons of God.

2. Wrath and vengeance on Thee fell,
That we might be sav’d from hell: ’
And shall we disdain to own
What Thou hast to us made known ?

3. Jesus, ere He gave His blood,
Was immers’d in Jordan’s flood;
There, and in that way, to show 
All He had to undergo.

4. In the watery grave we see,
Looking through it, Lord, to Thee,
Jesus, overwhelm’d in blood,
Sunk in wrath’s tremendous flood,

5. Thanks, eternal thanks to Thee,
That we thus can plainly seeBAPTISM.
Mercy, truth, and justice meet, 
All to make Thy bride complete.
