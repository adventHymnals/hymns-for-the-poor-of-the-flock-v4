```txt
1. Jesus, hail! exalted Saviour,
We adore Thy matchless grace;
Thou didst bear our misbehaviour, 
Suff’ring in our room and place ;
Wrath and terror 
Sunk Thy soul in deep disgrace.

2. For us Thou didst bear the horrors
Of the judgment unto blood;
Who can understand the sorrows 
Of Thy soul in wrath’s deep flood.
Fearful anguish!
Only fully known to God.

3. Yet, through grace, we know in measure,
What Thy love for us hath done,
And we hope, through Thy good pleasure, 
To behold Thee on Thy throne,
And for ever,
Sing the vict’ries Thou hast won.

4. By Thy Spirit’s operation,
Into death, Thy death, baptiz’d,
Risen with Thee, Thy Salvation 
Is by us no more despis’d:
Therefore baptism 
Must by us be dearly priz’d.
