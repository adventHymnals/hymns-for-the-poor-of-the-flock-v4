[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCQmGvwYH0dI1SwDJgKNoU0BXLL-QlVC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Glory unto Jesus be!
    From the curse Who set us free;
    All our guilt on Him was laid,
    He the ransom fully paid.

    2. All His blessed work is done,
    God’s well pleased in His Son,
    For He rais’d Him from the dead,
    Set Him over all as Head.

    3. All should sing His work and worth,
    All above, and all on earth,
    As they sing around the throne,
    "Thou art worthy, Thou alone.”

    4. Ye who love Him, cease to mourn,
    He will certainly return,
    AH His saints with Him shall reign,— 
    "Come, Lord Jesus, come! Amen.”
