[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1teccatDQym6oh%2Dh%2Dl28R8AukB6x2UUZh/edit?mode=html)



    1. While waiting for the Lord!
    (Mid foes and darkness still)
    Truth, light and grace beam from the word, 
    My soul with joy to fill.

    2. A Father’s gracious hand,
    Whose love can never fail,
    Upholds, sustains, and makes me stand, 
    Whatever foes assail.

    3. For Jesus, by His death
    Hath rent the veil in twain,
    That while I draw this fleeting breath,
    I might this blessing gain.

    4. Till known as I am known,
    Then still this grace afford;
    Till I repeat before the throne ,
    “For ever with the Lord.”
