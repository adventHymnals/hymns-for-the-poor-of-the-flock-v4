    1. Away with our sorrow and fear!
    We soon shall have enter’d our home; 
    The city of saints shall appear,
    The day of eternity come!108
    From earth we shall quickly remove,
    To dwell in our proper abode,
    In mansions of glory above—
    Prepar’d of our Father and God.

    2. And now, of His grace we receive,
    By faith in His own blessed word,
    ’Mid the throne in His glory to live—
    As we died in the death of our Lord.
    These riches, conferr’d by His grace,
    Shed holy affection around;
    That all, full of love and of praise,
    May gladly in service abound!
