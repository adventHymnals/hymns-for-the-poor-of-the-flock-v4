    1. Shepherd of the chosen number,
    They are safe whom Thou dost keep; 
    Other shepherds faint and slumber,
    And forget to guard the sheep.
    Watchful Shepherd!
    Thou dost wake while others sleep.

    2. When the Shepherd’s life was needful,
    Or the sheep must else be lost,
    Not of Thine own safety heedful,
    But of their’s alone, Thou wast:
    Thou didst save them;
    But no tongue can tell the co st!
