    1. Grace is the sweetest sound 
    That ever reach’d our ears!
    When conscience charg’d and justice frown’d, 
    ’Twas grace remov’d our fears.
    H106

    2.’Tis freedom to the slave,
    ’Tis light and liberty;
    It takes its terror from the grave,
    From death its victory.

    3. Grace is a mine of wealth
    Laid open to the p oor;
    Grace is the sov’reign spring of health;
    ’Tis Life for evermore.

    4. This grace then let us sing!
    (O joyful, wondrous them e!)
    Who grace has brought, shall glory bring, 
    And we shall reign with Him.

    5. Then shall we see His face
    With all the saints above,
    And sing for ever of His grace,
    For ever of His love.
