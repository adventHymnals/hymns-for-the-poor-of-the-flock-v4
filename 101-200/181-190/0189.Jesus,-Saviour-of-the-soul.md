    1. Jesus, Saviour of the soul,
    Let us to Thy bosom fly,
    While the raging billows roll,
    While the tempest still is high;
    Hide us, O our Saviour, hide,
    Till the storm of life is past:
    Safe into the haven guide,
    There receive Thy church at last.

    2. Other refuge have we none,
    Helpless, hanging still on Thee; 
    Leave, O leave us not alone,
    Still our stay and comfort b e;
    All our trust on Thee is stay’d,
    All our help from Thee we b rin g; 
    Cover each defenceless head 
    With the shadow of Thy wing.

    3. Thou, O Lord, art all we want,
    Boundless love in Thee we find; 
    Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
    Heal the sick, and lead the blind. 
    Just and holy is Thy name,
    We are all unrighteousness;
    We are full of sin and shame 
    Thou art full of truth and grace.

    4. Plenteous grace with Thee is found
    Grace to pardon ev’ry sin;
    Let the healing streams abound, 
    Make and keep us pure within. 
    Thou of life the fountain art,
    Freely let us take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within each heart, 
    Rise to all eternity.
