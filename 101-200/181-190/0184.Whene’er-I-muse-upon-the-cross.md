    1. W hen I behold the wondrous cross
    On which the Lord of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.

    2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
    Save in the death of Christ, my God;
    All the vain things that charm’d me most, 
    I’ d sacrifice them to His blood.185

    3. By suffering there, beneath His feet
    He trod the fierce Avenger down; 
    There, power itself and weakness meet, 
    Emblems of each yon thorny crown!

    4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were an off’ring far too small; 
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my soul, my life, my all.
