    1. We long to behold Him array’d
    With glory and light from above, 
    The Lord in His beauty display’d,
    The beauty of holiest love.
    We hasten and sigh to be there, 
    Where Jesus shall fix His abode,
    To see Him descend in the air,
    With all the bright glory of God.

    2. With Him we on Zion shall stand,
    (For Jesus hath spoken the word) — 
    And all of Immanuel’s land,
    Survey in the sight of the Lord.183
    But when on His bosom reclin’d,
    His face we are strengthen’d to see, 
    Our joyfulness, Lord, we shall find, 
    Our heaven of heavens in Thee.
