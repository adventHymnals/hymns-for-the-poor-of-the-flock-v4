    1. Sweeter sounds than music knows,
    Charm us in the Saviour’s nam e;
    All the Church’s gladness flows
    From His birth, and cross, and shame

    2. Did the Lord a man become,
    That He might the law fulfil?
    Bleed and suffer in our room?
    And can any tongue be still?
    X82

    3. No, we will our praises bring,
    Though they worthless are and weak; 
    For, should we refuse to sing,
    Sure, the very stones would speak.

    4. O our Saviour! shield and sun,
    Shepherd, brother, husband, friend, 
    Ev’ry precious name in one,
    We would praise Thee without end.
