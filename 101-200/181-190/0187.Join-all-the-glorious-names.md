    1. Join all the glorious names
    Of wisdom, love, and pow’r,
    That mortals ever knew,
    That angels ever b ore;
    All are too mean to speak His worth, 
    Too mean to set the Saviour forth.

    2. Great Prophet of our God!
    Our tongues must bless Thy name, 
    By Whom the joyful news 
    Of our salvation came;
    The joyful news of sins forgiv’n,
    Of hell subdu’d, of peace with heav’n.

    3. Thou art our Counsellor,
    Our Pattern, and our Guide,
    And Thou our Shepherd a r t;
    Ah, keep us near Thy side;
    Nor let our feet e’er run astray,
    Or wander in the crooked way.

    4. We love Thy well-known voice,
    And trust Thine eye to keep 
    Our wand'ring souls among 
    The thousands of God’s sheep;
    Feed Thou His flock, call Thou their names, 
    And gently lead the tender lambs.
