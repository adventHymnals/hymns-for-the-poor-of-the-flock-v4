    1. Should all the hosts of death,
    And pow’rs of hell unknown,
    Put their most dreadful forms 
    Of rage and mischief on,
    We shall be safe, while Christ displays 
    His guardian and Almighty grace.

    2. O Thou Almighty Lord!
    Hell’s conqueror and King,
    Thy sceptre and Thy sword,
    Thy love and grace we sing;189
    Thine is our pow’r, and we would sit,
    In willing bonds, close at Thy feet.

    3. Yet, help us now to rise,
    And tread the tempter down;
    O Jesus, lead us forth
    To conquest, and the crown;
    And feeble saints shall win the day, 
    Though death and Hell obstruct the way.
