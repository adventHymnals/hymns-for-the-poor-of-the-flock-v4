    1. Jesus, the Christ! eternal W ord! 
    Of all creation Sovereign Lord!
    On Thee alone, by faith we rest;
    And lean our weakness on Thy breast.

    2. Thy blood hath wash’d us from our sin; 
    Thy Spirit sanctifies w ithin!
    And Thou for us, in all our need,
    At God’s right hand dost ever plead.

    3. O keep us in the narrow way,
    That ne’er from Thee our footsteps stray: 
    Sustain our weakness; calm our fear;
    And to Thy presence keep us near.

    4. And be it thus till th at blest day,
    When God shall wipe all tears away.
    " Quickly”—’tis promis’d in the word; 
    E’en so. Amen. Come quickly, Lord!
