    1. The God Who dwells above, we call
    Our Father and our Friend:
    And, blessed th ou gh t! His children all 
    Shall see Him in the end.

    2. Though now dispers’d, the day will come
    When He Who made us His,151
    Will take us hence, and bear us home 
    To see Him as He is,

    3. Though now unknown, we then shall be
    The sons of God confess’d;
    Those Who disown us then shall see 
    That we alone are bless’d.

    4. Then let us, brethren, while on earth,
    With foes and strangers mix’d,
    Be mindful of our heav’nly birth,
    Our thoughts on glory fix’d.

    5. That we should glorify Him here
    Our Father’s purpose is;
    And when the Saviour shall appear,
    He will declare us His.
