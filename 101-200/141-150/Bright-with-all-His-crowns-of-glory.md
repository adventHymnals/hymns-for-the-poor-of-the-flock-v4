    1. B r ig h t with all His crowns of glory
    See the royal Victor’s brow;
    Once for sinners marr’d and gory— 
    See the Lamb exalted now,
    While before Him 
    All His ransom’d brethren bow.


    2. THE CHURCH.
    Blessed momingl long expected,
    Lo, they fill the peopled air, 
    Mourners once, by man rejected, 
    They, with Him, exalted there, 
    Sing His praises,
    And His throne of glory share.

    3. ISRAEL.
    Judah 1 Lo thy royal Lion
    Reigns on earth, a conqu’ring King, 
    Come, ye ransom’d tribes! to Zion, 
    Love’s abundant off ring bring;
    There behold Him,
    And His ceaseless praises sing.

    4. THE GENTILES.
    King of kings! let earth adore Him,
    High on His exalted throne.
    Fall, ye nations, fall before Him,
    And His righteous sceptre own;
    All the glory
    Be to Him, and Him alone!
