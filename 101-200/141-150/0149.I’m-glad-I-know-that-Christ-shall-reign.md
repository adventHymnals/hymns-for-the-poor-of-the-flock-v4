    1. I’m glad I know that Christ shall reign 
    In glory, glory, glory,
    And come to earth on clouds again, 
    With glory, glory, glory:
    ’Tis glory’s foretaste makes me sing 
    Of glory, glory, glory,
    And to the Saviour praises bring;
    Sing glory, glory, glory!

    2.' I hope to see Him on His throne,
    Sing glory, glory, glory!
    When He shall come to meet His own,
    In glory, glory, glory!
    I’ll sing, while, mounting through the air 
    Of glory, glory, glory!
    And meet my Father’s children there,
    In glory, glory, glory!

    3. Come on, my friends, let’s mend our pace 
    To glory, glory, glory!
    For we shall see Him face to face,
    In glory, glory, glory!
    The Bride shall reign—the Bridegroom too, 
    In glory, glory, glory I 
    Let’s keep the blessed prize in view:
    'Tis glory, glory, glory!
