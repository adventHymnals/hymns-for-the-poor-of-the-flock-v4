    1. Brightness of the Father’s glory,
    Shall Thy praise unutter’d lie?
    Who would hush the boundless story, 
    Of the Lamb Who came to die;

    2. Came from off the throne eternal,
    Down to Calv’ry’s depth of woe, 
    Came to crush the pow’rs infernal?— 
    Streams of praises ceaseless flow!

    3. Sing the Lamb’s triumphant rising;
    Sing Him on the Father’s throne;148—14 9
    Sing—till heav’n and earth surprising, 
    Reigns the Nazarene alone.
