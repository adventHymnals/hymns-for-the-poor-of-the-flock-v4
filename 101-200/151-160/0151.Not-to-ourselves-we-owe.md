    1. N ot to ourselves we owe 
    That we, O God, are Thine;
    Jesus, the Sun, our night broke through, 
    And gave us light divine.

    2. The Father’s grace and love,
    This blessed mercy gave,
    And Jesus left the throne above,
    The wand’ring sheep to save.

    3. No more the heirs of wrath,—
    The smile of peace we see;
    And, Father, in confiding faith,
    We cast our souls on Thee.

    4. We drink the living stream
    To all Thy children giv’n,
    The love which Thou hast made to beam 
    From Christ, the Heir of Heaven.

    5. With the adopted band,
    Soon shall we see Thee there;
    With them and Him in glory stand,
    And all His honours share.
