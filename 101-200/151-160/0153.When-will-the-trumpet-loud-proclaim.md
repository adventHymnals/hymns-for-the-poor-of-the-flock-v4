    1. When will the trumpet loud proclaim 
    The judgment of the martyr’d Lamb? 
    When will the captive saints be free, 
    And keep th’ eternal jubilee?

    2. O Father, let that day appear,
    The promis’d Great Sabbatic Year;
    When freed from sin, and toil, and pain, 
    Thy ransom’d shall in glory reign.

    3. Till then we cannot let Thee rest,
    But still repeat our strong request;
    And this our constant cry shall be,
    Lord, sound the trump of jubilee.
