    1. W e sing the praise of Him Who died, 
    Of Him Who died upon the cross, 
    The sinner’s H o p e-let men deride;
    For this we count the world but loss.


    2. Inscrib’d upon the cross we see,
    In shining letters, " God i s Love!* 
    The Lamb Who died upon the tre e;
    Has brought us mercy from above.

    3. The Cross! it takes our guilt away,
    It holds the fainting spirit up;
    It cheers with hope the gloomy day,
    And sweetens ev’ry bitter cup.

    4. It makes the coward spirit brave,
    And nerves the feeble arm for fight;
    It takes its terror from the grave,
    And gilds the bed of death with light.

    5. The balm of life, the cure of woe,
    The measure and the pledge of love, 
    The sinners’ refuge here below,
    The angels’ theme in heav’n above.
