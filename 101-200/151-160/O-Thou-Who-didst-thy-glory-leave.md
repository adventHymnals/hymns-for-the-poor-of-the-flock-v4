    1. O Thou Who didst Thy glory leave, 
    Apostate sinners to retrieve 
    From nature’s deadly fall;
    As Thou hast bought us with a price, 
    Our sins against us ne’er can rise, 
    For Thou hast borne them all.

    2. We sing One smitten in our stead, 
    Him Who without the city bled
    To expiate our stain;
    Who, God of God, vouchsaf’d to dwell 
    In flesh, to make of full avail 
    The sufFrings of the man.

    3. See Him for our transgressions giv’n, 
    See the incarnate God of heav’n,
    For us, His foes, expire;
    Rejoice! rejoice! the tidings hear!
    He bore, that we might never bear,
    His Father’s righteous ire.

    4. Ye saints, “the Man of sorrows” bless, 
    The Lord, for your unrighteousness
    Deputed to atone;
    Praise, till with all the ransom’d throng 
    Ye sing the never-ending song,
    And sit upon His throne!
