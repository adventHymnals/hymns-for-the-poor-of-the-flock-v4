    1. It hath not fully yet appear’d
    What blessedness to saints is giv’n; 
    No eye hath seen, no ear hath heard, 
    No heart conceiv’d the joy of heav’n.153

    2. The mind of God, and it alone,
    The joy prepar’d hath understood;
    "When saints shall know as they are known, 
    And shall behold the face of God—

    3. The face of Him, Who here below
    Appear’d, and died to save His own;
    The same Who dwells in glory now,
    And sits upon the Father’s throne.

    4. The sight of Him His saints shall fill
    With transport never known before;
    They’ll feel no want, and fear no ill,
    Nor sin nor sorrow any more.

    5. Then blest our lo t! for we are His,
    And we shall dwell with Him above;
    Yea, we shall see Him as He is,
    The Lord of grace, of truth, and love.
