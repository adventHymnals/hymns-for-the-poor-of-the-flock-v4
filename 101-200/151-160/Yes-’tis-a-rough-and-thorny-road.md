    1. Yes!’tis a rough and thorny road 
    That leads us to the saints’ abode;
    But when our Father’s house we gain, 
    'Twill make amends for all our pain.

    2. And though we feel our present grief,
    In hope we find a sweet relief;
    For hope anticipates the day,
    When all our grief shall pass away.

    3. And what is all we suffer now,
    Or all we can endure below,
    To that bright day when Christ shall come 
    And take His weary pilgrims home?

    4. Then let us tread, without complaint,
    The thorny road, and never faint;
    Though now by weariness opprest,
    The end is everlasting rest.
