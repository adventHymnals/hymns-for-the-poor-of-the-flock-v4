    1. We give Thee thanks unfeigned,
    O Jesus! Friend in need,
    For what Thy soul sustained,
    When Thou for us didst bleed; 
    Grant us to lean unshaken 
    Upon Thy faithfulness;
    Until to glory taken,
    We see Thee face to face.

    2. And O what consolation
    Doth in our hearts take place, 
    While we Thy toil and passion 
    Do joyfully retrace!
    Ah! should we, while thus musing 
    On our Redeemer’s cross,161
    E’en life itself be losing,
    Great gain would be that loss.
