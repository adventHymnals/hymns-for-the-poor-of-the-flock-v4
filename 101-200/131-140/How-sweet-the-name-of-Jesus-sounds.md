    1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer’s ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
    And drives away his fear.

    2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary rest.

    3. Dear nam e! the rock on which I build;
    My shield and hiding-place;
    My never-failing treas’ry, fill’d 
    With boundless stores of grace.

    4. Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
    My Prophet, Priest, and King;
    My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, 
    Accept the praise I bring.

    5. Weak is the effort of my heart,
    And cold my warmest thou ght;
    But when I see Thee as Thou art,
    I’ll praise Thee as I ought.

    6. Till then I would Thy love proclaim
    W ith ev’ry fleeting breath;
    And triumph in that blessed name 
    Which quells the power of Death.
