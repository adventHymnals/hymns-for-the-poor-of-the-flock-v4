    1. H ar k , the glad sound! the Saviour comes! 
    The Saviour promis’d long!
    Take up the word, ye saved saints,
    Renew the gladsome song.

    2. He comes! creation to release
    In Satan’s bondage held;
    The Tyrant’s thraldom to destroy, 
    And make th’ Usurper yield.

    3. He comes! the mighty foe to bind,
    The groaning earth to free;
    While (chief of all free grace’s gifts) 
    Himself its Lord shall be.

    4. Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
    Thy welcome shall proclaim;
    And all creation shall rejoice 
    In Thy beloved name.
