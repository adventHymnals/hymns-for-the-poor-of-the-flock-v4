    1. W e are not come to the burning brow, 
    Whence the fiery streams of vengeance flow, 
    To the voice of words, and the trumpet-sound, 
    Where the prostrate hosts lay quaking round;

    2. But we are come to the angels’ abode,
    That numberless wait round the throne of God, 
    Tothechurch of the first-born enroll’d on high, 
    And the spirits of saints who no more may die;

    3. And we are come to the sprinkled shrine, 
    Where Justice and Mercy unitedly shine,
    And the still, small voice of the blood that shed 
    It’s blessing on the murderer’s head:

    4.’Tis “Peace” to us our God thus speaks, 
    Before His vengeance in thunder breaks;
    He shall shake the skies, the seas and the shore, 
    He shall shake them once, and shall shake no 
    ,jnore.
