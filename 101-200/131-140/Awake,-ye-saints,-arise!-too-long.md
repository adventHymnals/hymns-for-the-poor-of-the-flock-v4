    1. Awake, ye saints, arise! too long
    In heaviness we sing,
    ’Tis time to raise a gladlier song,
    And strike a louder string;

    2. In faith we wait for that dear place
    The lov’d Apostle view’d,
    When full before his ravish’d gaze,
    The Holy City stood.

    3. L o! where the pearly gates unfold,
    A kingly, priestly train,
    With robes of white, and crowns of gold, 
    Ascend with Christ to re ign!

    4. No moon, in borrow’d glory bright,
    No Sun, remotely fair;
    Jehovah-Jesus is the light,
    Their joy—The Lord is there l

    5. God of the new Jerusalem,
    From Thee this glory flows,
    Be ours the grace that prosper’d them,
    And ours the same repose.
