    1. Jesus, Thou glorious Priest and King,
    Accept the tribute which we bring;
    Accept each feeble song of praise,
    Which here on earth Thy saints may raise.

    2. May every minute as it flies,
    Increase our love, improve our jo ys;
    Till we are brought to sing Thy name 
    At the great supper of the Lamb.

    3. O that the months would roll away,
    And quickly bring the marriage-day;
    When Thou the Lamb shalt take Thy throne, 
    And fully there the Church shalt own.

    4. The gladness of that happy day,
    In this sad world’s our strength and stay— 
    Then let not faith forsake its hold,
    Lest comfort sink, and love grow cold.
