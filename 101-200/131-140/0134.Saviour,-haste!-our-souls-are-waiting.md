[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qcO2pg2pOUsmc3coTwCC3lyrj_bdh0uJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour, haste! our souls are waiting
    For the long expected day,
    When, new heav’ns and earth creating, 
    Thou shalt banish grief away,
    All the sorrow,
    Caus’d by sin and Satan’s sway.

    2. H aste! O hasten Thine appearing!
    Take Thy mourning people home: 
    ’Tis this hope our spirits cheering, ■ 
    While we in the desert roam,
    Makes Thy people
    Strangers here, till Thou dost come.

    3. Lord, how long shall the creation
    Groan and travail sore in pain; 
    Waiting for its sure salvation,
    When Thou shalt in glory reign,
    And like Eden,
    This sad earth shall bloom again?

    4. Gather, too, Thy chosen nation,
    Israel’s long afflicted race;
    Let them find Thy free salvation,
    Own and trust Thy wondrous grace; 
    And adoring,
    Look on Thy once marred face.

    5. Reign, O reign, Almighty Saviour! 
    Heav’n and earth in one unite; 
    Make it known, that in Thy favour, 
    There alone is life and light: 
    When we see Thee,
    We shall have unmix’d delight.
