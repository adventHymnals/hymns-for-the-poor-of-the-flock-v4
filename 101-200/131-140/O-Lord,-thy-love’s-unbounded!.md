    1. O Lord, Thy love’s unbounded!
    So full, so vast, so free!
    Our thoughts are all confounded 
    Whene’er we think of Thee:
    For us Thou cams’t from Heav’n,
    For us to bleed and die;
    That purchas’d and forgiven,
    We might ascend on High.

    2. O let this, love constrain us
    To give our hearts to Thee:
    Let nothing henceforth pain us,
    But that which paineth Thee.
    Our joy, our one endeavour—
    Thro’ sufFring, conflict, shame,—
    To serve Thee, gracious Saviour,
    And magnify Thy name.
