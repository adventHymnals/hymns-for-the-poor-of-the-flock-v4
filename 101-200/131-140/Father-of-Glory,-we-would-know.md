    1. Father of Glory, we would know 
    The richest gifts Thine hands bestow;
    » The hope of our high calling see,
    ! And scan our immortality.

    2. Th’ exceeding greatness of Thy pow’r 
    To us-ward who believe, secure,
    The depths of love Thy wisdom plann’d, 
    The works and wonders of Thy hand.

    3. This was the power in Jesus wrought, 
    "When from the dead the Son was brought, 
    Then set at God’s right hand on high, 
    Above all principality.

    4. Above dominion, might, and name,
    Of noblest rank, or widest fame,
    In this our earthly, fading home,
    Or worlds, or kingdoms yet to come.

    5. Thus to the Son were all things given,
    All for the Church, the Bride of heaven, 
    Jehovah-Jesus’ meet abode,
    The fulness of th’ unbounded God.
