    1. “We’ve no abiding city here
    This may distress the worldling’s mind, 
    But should not cost the saint a tear,
    Who hopes a better rest to find.

    2. “W e’ve no abiding city here
    Sad thought 1 were this to be our home 
    But let this truth our spirits cheer,
    We seek a city yet to come.

    3. “W e’ve no abiding city here
    Then let us live as pilgrims do;
    Let not the world our rest appear,
    But let us haste from all below.

    4. “W e’ve no abiding city here
    We seek a city out of sight,
    Jerusalem! faith sees it near,
    Brilliant with everlasting light.
