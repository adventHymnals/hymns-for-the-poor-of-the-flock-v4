    1. Children of God! who, pacing slow,
    Your pilgrim path pursue,
    In strength and weakness, joy and woe, 
    To God’s high calling t ru e!

    2. Why move ye on with ling’ring tread,
    A doubtful, mourning band?
    Why faintly hangs the drooping head? 
    Why drops the feeble hand?181

    3. O! weak to know the Saviour’s pow’r,
    To trust the Father’s care;
    A moment’s toil, a passing show’r,
    Is all the grief ye share!

    4. The Lord of light, absent awhile
    Shall soon His glory bring,
    And you in all that glory smile,
    Whilst you His praises sing.

    5. Then rescu’d from the gloomy shroud
    Which doth this world invest,
    He’ll raise you on His glorious cloud, 
    And guide you to His rest
