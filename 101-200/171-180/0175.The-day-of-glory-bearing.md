    1. The day of glory bearing
    Its brightness far and near,
    The day of Christ’s appearing 
    We now no longer fear;

    2. He once a spotless victim
    For us on Calv’ry bled; 
    Jehovah did afflict Him,
    And bruis’d Him in our stead.

    3. But now H e’s interceding
    For us who on Him r est;
    And grace from Him proceeding, 
    Tells us in Him we’re blest.

    4. Then let Him come in glory,
    Who comes His saints to raise, 
    To perfect all the story 
    Of wonder, love, and praise.
