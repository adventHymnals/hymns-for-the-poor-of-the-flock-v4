    1. From Egypt lately freed,
    By the Redeemer’s grace,
    A rough and thorny path we tread.
    To see Him face to face

    2. The promis’d rest and peace
    Are still in constant view;
    How difFrent to the wilderness 
    We now are passing through!

    3. Here grief, and care, and pain,
    And fears distress us sore;
    But there celestial pleasures reign,
    And we shall weep no more.
