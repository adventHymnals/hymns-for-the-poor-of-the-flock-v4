    1. Foh Sion’s sake I will not rest;
    I will not hold my peace,
    Until Jerusalem be blest,
    And Judah dwell at ease.

    2. Until her righteousness return,
    As day-break after n igh t;
    The lamp of her salvation bum 
    With everlasting light.

    3. The Gentiles shall her glory view,
    And kings declare her fame,
    And hers shall be a title new,
    Which Israel’s God shall name.

    4. The Lord shall hold her with His hand,
    And wear her for His own,
    His diadem her beauteous land,
    Her royalty His crown.

    5. And ev’ry tribe, and ev’ry land,
    Shall hear the joyful word,174
    “The holy people are at hand,
    “Redeemed of the Lord.”
