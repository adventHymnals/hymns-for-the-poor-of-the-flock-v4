    1. Here we rest,—in wonder viewing
    All our sins on Jesus laid!
    And a full redemption flowing 
    From the sacrifice He made.

    2. Truly blessed is the station!
    Thus upon the Lamb to rest,
    And to know in God’s salvation,
    How the saints are fully blest.

    3. Here we find the dawn of heaven.
    While upon the Lamb we gaze,
    See our trespasses forgiven,
    And our songs of triumph raise.

    4. O h! that strong in faith abiding,
    We may to the Saviour cleave, 
    Nought with Him our hearts dividing, 
    All for Him content to leave.

    5. May we still, God’s mind discerning,
    To the Lamb for wisdom go;
    There new wonders daily learning,
    All the Father’s glory know.
