    1. Jesus, lead us by Thy power
    Safe into the promis’d r est;
    Choose the paththe way whatever 
    Seems to Thee, O Lord! the best; 
    Be our guide in ev’ry peril,
    Watch and keep us night and day, 
    Else our foolish hearts will wander 
    From the straight and narrow way.

    2. Since in Thee we found redemption,
    And Salvation full and free,
    Nothing can our souls dishearten 
    But forgetfulness of Thee;
    Nought can stay our steady progress, 
    More than conq’rors we shall be,
    If our eye, whate’er the danger, 
    Looks to Thee, and none but Thee.

    3. In Thy presence we are happy;
    In Thy presence we’re secure;
    In Thy presence all afflictions 
    We can easily endure;1 7 8 -1 7 9
    In Thy presence we can conquer,
    We Can suffer, we can die;
    Wand’ring from Thee we are feeble;
    Let Thy love, then, keep us nigh.
