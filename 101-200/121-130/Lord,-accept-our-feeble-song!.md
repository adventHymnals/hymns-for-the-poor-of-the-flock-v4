    1. Lord, accept our feeble song!
    Pow’r and praise to Thee belong;
    We would all Thy grace record,
    Holy, holy, holy Lord!

    2. Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop, 
    Thence is all Thy people’s hope;
    Thou wast poor, that we might be 
    Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.

    3. When we think of love like this,
    Joy and shame our hearts possess;
    Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus, 
    Shame, for such returns from us.

    4. Yet we hope the day to see,
    When we shall from sin be free;
    When to Thee in glory brought,
    We shall serve Thee as we ought.
