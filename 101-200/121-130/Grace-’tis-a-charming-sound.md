    1. Grace!’Tis a charming sound,
    Harmonious to the ear;
    Heav’n with the echo shall resound, 
    And all the earth shall hear.

    2. Grace taught our wand’ring feet
    To tread the heav'nly road;
    And new supplies, each hour we meet, 
    While walking thus with God.124

    3.’Twas Grace that wrote each name
    In Life’s eternal book;
    ’Twas Grace that gave us to the Lamb 
    Whp all our sorrows took.

    4. Grace sav’d us from the foe,
    Grace taught us how to p ray;
    And God will ne’er His grace forego,
    Till we have won the day.

    5. May Grace, free Grace, inspire
    Our souls with strength divine;
    May all our thoughts to God aspire,
    And Grace in service shine.
