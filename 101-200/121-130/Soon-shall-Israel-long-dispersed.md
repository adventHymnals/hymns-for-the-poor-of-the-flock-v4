    1. Soon shall Israel, long dispersed,
    Mourning, seek the Lord their God; 
    Look on Him Whom once they pierced, 
    Own and kiss the chast’ning rod.

    2. Then all Isr’el shall be saved,
    War and tum ult then shall cease; 
    While the Blessed Son of David 
    Rules a conquer’d world in peace.

    3. Zion’s King shall reign victorious,
    All the earth shall own His sway;
    He will make His kingdom glorious, 
    And shall reign through endless day.
