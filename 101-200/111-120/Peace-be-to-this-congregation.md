    1. Peace be to this congregation,
    Peace to ev’ry Saint therein,
    Peace, the foretaste of salvation;
    Peace, the fruit of pardon’d sin, 
    Peace, that speaks its heaVnly Giver— 
    Peace to worldly minds unknown, 
    Peace divine, that flows for ever 
    From its source, the Lord alone!

    2. Prince of Peace, be ever near us,
    Till Thou take us to Thy home!
    Till Thy bright appearing cheer us,
    Till Thy peaceful kingdom come!
    Deign,—with sweetest consolation,
    Deign to give our souls to prove 
    All the pow’r of Thy salvation,
    Full submission, faith, and love!
