    1. Loo k, ye saints, look there and wonder!
    See the place where Jesus lay:
    He has burst the bands asunder;
    He has borne our sins away.
    Joyful tidings!
    Yes, the Lord is ris’n, we say.

    2. Jesus triumph’d! Sing ye praises;
    By His death He overcame:
    Thus the Lord His glory raises;
    Thus He fills His foes with shame.
    Sing ye praises!
    Praises to the Victor’s name.
