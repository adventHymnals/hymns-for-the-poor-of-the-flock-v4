    1. Awake, each saint, in joyful lays,
    To sing thy great Redeemer's praise 
    He justly claims a song from thee:
    His loving-kindness, O how free!

    2. He saw thee ruin’d in the fall,
    Yet lov’d thee, notwithstanding all;
    He sav’d thee from thy low estate:
    His loving-kindness, O how great!

    3. Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes, 
    Though earth and hell its way oppose; 
    He safely leads His church along:
    His loving-kindness, O how strong!

    4. When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
    Has gather’d thick, and thunder”d loud; 
    He with His Church has always stood: 
    His loving-kindness, O how good!

    5. Soon shall we mount and soar away,
    To the bright realms of endless day; 
    And sing with rapture and surprise,
    His loving-kindness in the skies.116
