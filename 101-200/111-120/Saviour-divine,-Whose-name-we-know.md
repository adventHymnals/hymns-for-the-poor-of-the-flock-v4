    1. S aviour divine, Whose name we know,
    In Whom alone we trust,
    Thou art the Lord our Righteousness,
    Thou art Thy people’s boast.

    2. The soul, by sin howe’er defil’d,
    By guilt howe’er opprest,
    In Thee believing, stands approv’d,
    And finds abiding rest.

    3. To Thee, our great redeeming Lord,
    What lasting thanks we owe,
    For raising sinners to such joys,
    From depths of endless w oe!
