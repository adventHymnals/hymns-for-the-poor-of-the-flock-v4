    1. N othing but Thy blood, O Jesus,
    Could relieve the sinnerâ€™s sm art; 
    Nothing else from guilt release us, 
    Nothing else could melt the heart.

    2. Sense of sin doth only harden
    All the while it works alone;
    But the grace that seals our pardon, 
    Soon dissolves a heart of stone.

    1.12 -11 3
