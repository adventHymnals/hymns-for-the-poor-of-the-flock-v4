    1. O God, our languid hearts inspire, 
    (For here we know Thou a rt);
    And freely of Thy heav’nly fire,
    To every soul impart.119

    2. For Jesus’ sake, we pray Thee, here
    Thy presence now display;
    As Thou hast giv’n a place for pray’r, 
    So give us faith to pray.

    3. Amongst us, Lord, let holy peace,
    And love, and concord dwell;
    And give each troubl’d conscience ease, 
    Each wounded spirit heal.

    4. May we in faith' receive Thy word,
    In faith present our p rayer;
    And in the bosom of our Lord 
    Cast off our ev’ry care.
