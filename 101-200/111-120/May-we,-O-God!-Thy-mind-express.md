    1. May we, O God! Thy mind express, 
    Stand forth Thy chosen witnesses;
    Thy pow’r unto salvation shew,
    In love and holiness below.

    2. The fulness of Thy grace-receive,
    And simply to Thy glory live;
    Strongly reflect the light divine,
    And in a world of darkness shine.

    3. In us let all mankind behold
    How Christians liv’d in days of old; 
    Mighty their envious foes to move,
    A prbverb of reproach—and love.

    4. O make us of one soul and heart,
    The all-conforming mind impart,
    And grant us peace and unity 1
    As taught, renew’d, and rul’d by Thee.
