    1. The Cross! the Cross! O that’s our gain, 
    Because on that the Lamb was slain;
    ’Twas there the Lord was crucified,
    ’Twas there for us the Saviour died.1 14

    2. What wondrous cause could move Thy heart, 
    To take on Thee our curse and smart,
    Well knowing we should ever be 
    So cold, so negligent of Thee!

    3. The cause was love,—we sink with shame 
    Before our blessed Jesu’s nam e;
    That He should bleed and suffer thus,
    Because He lov’d and pitied us.
