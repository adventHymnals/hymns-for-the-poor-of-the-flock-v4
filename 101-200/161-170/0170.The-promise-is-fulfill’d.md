[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhMgvN_T9yIXa0Re7jLAJb0v2z1gV-0-/edit?mode=html)



    1. The promise is fulfill’d,
    Salvation’s work is done;
    Justice and Mercy reconcil’d,
    For God has rais’d His Son.

    2. He left death’s sad abode,
    From all corruption free;
    The holy, harmless, Son of God 
    Could no corruption see.

    3. In Him the saints are ris’n,
    From guilt and judgment clear,
    And now upon the throne of heav’n,
    In Him their Head appear.
