    1. Great Leader of the church of God,
    We sing Thy conqu’ring name,
    Legions of foes beset Thee round,
    But all were put to shame.

    2. Avict’ry, glorious and complete,
    Thou by Thy death didst gain;
    So in Thy cause would we contend,
    And all for Thee sustain.

    3. While onward to the conflict led,
    No sorrow would we fear,
    Prepar’d our ransom’d lives to shed,
    Nor count them to us dear.

    4. W e’d trace the footsteps Thou hast trod
    To glory and renown;
    Sustain Thy combat and Thy cross,
    As call’d to share Thy crown.
