[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzkVys7nKaWi%2Dhqh27qp6dqGTLdIB6XF/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Saviour, we are Thine
    In everlasting bands;
    Our names, our hearts, we would resign 
    Into Thy gracious hands.

    2. To Thee we now would cleave
    With firm and faithful zeal,
    Though often press’d Thy paths to leave, 
    Oh let not sin prevail!

    3. Our lives we’d gladly lose
    As not our own but Thine;
    For Thee the tempter’s wiles refuse,
    And all the world resign.

    4. Let nothing from us hide
    The glory of Thy day,
    But keep us ever near Thy side 
    Through all life’s gloomy way.

    5. Since Thou and we are one,
    We know we need not fear;
    If Thou in heav’n hast fix’d Thy throne 
    We too are fixed there.
