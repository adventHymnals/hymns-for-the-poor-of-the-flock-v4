    1. Great Saviour of the church, we own
    Thy precepts all divinely wise;
    O may Thy mighty pow’r be known,
    To keep them all before our eyes.

    2. Deep on our hearts Thy word engrave,
    And fill our breasts with heav’nly zeal 
    That while we trust Thy Love to save, 
    We may Thy sacred word fulfil.

    3. Adorn’d with ev’ry heav’nly grace,
    May we in service brightly shine;
    And the full glory of Thy face 
    Reflected beam from each of Thine.

    4. That lovely image, true and fair,
    Our heav’nly Father shall proclaim; 
    And men that see its brightness there, 
    Shall join to glorify His name.

    5. Of tru th the pillar and the ground,
    May we continue all our days;
    In love and discipline be found,
    As truly witnessing His praise.
