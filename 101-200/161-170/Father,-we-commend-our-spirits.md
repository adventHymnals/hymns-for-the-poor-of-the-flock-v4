[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaBkW3bRs54UP8BBLK8CxEohVc8tyft1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father, we commend our spirits
    To Thy love in Jesu’s name,
    Love, which His atoning merits 
    Give us confidence to claim.

    2. O how sweet, how real a pleasure
    Flows from love so true and free! 
    O how great, how rich a treasure, 
    Saviour, we possess in Thee!

    3. From the world and its confusions
    Here we turn and find our rest,
    From its care and its delusions,
    Turn to Thee, and there are blest.

    4. Though this scene is ever changing,
    Since Thy mercy changes not,
    O’er the waste our spirits ranging 
    Glory in their happy lot.

    5. By the Holy Ghost anointed,
    May we do our Father’s will,
    Walk the path by Him appointed,
    Jesu’s pleasure to fulfil.

    6. Till the welcome signal hearing,
    Welcome to the saints alone,
    We rejoice at His appearing,
    Who shall claim us for His own.
