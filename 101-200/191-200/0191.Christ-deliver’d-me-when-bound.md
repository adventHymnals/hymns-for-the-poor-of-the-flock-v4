[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNamc_WYdMf3MUGQK8xzSVAUXdTK_uv5/edit?mode=html)



    1. Christ deliver’d me when bound,
    And, when wounded, heal’d my wound, 
    Sought me wand’ring, set me right, 
    Turn’d my darkness into light.

    2. Can a mother’s tender care 
    Cease toward the child she bare?
    Yes, she may forgetful be,
    Yet will He remember me.

    3. His is an unchanging love,
    Higher than the heights above,
    Deeper than the depths beneath,
    Free and faithful, strong as death.

    4. I shall see His glory soon,
    When the work of grace is done,
    Partner of His throne shall b e;
    Such His wondrous love to me!

    5. This alone is my complaint,
    That my love is weak and fain t;
    Yet I love Him, and adore,
    O for grace to love Him more 1
