    1. Thro’ the Holy Ghost it is,
    Christ is ours, and we are H is;
    Earth and hell in vain combine,
    To dissolve this tie Divine.

    2. Since we ere the Father’s care;
    None beside need we to fear,
    Us to Jesus He hath giv’n,
    Sons of God, and heirs of Heav’n. ,

    3. In His death we met our doom,
    He our Shepherd is become;
    Strong in His full strength we stand, 
    None can pluck us from His hand.

    4. In this Shepherd’s love secure,
    To the end we shall endure,
    In His service onward go,
    Till we conquer ev’ry foe.
