    1. Thy gracious presence, O, our God,
    Our ev’ry wish contains;
    With this, beneath temptation’s load, 
    The heart no more complains.

    2. This can our ev’ry care control,
    Gild each dark scene with light;
    This is the sunshine of the soul: 
    Without it all is night.

    3. O happy scenes of pure delight,
    Where Love’s full beams impart 
    Unclouded beauty to the sight,
    And gladness to the heart.

    4. Our place in those fair realms of bliss,
    Our spirits long to know;
    Our wishes terminate in this,
    Nor can they rest below.

    5. Nor do these wishes of the heart
    Seem foolish, Lord, to Thee;
    For thou hast said, that where Thou art, 
    There we shall ever be.195

    6. Thus can our cheerful spirits sing 
    The darkest hour away,
    And rise on faith’s expanded wing, 
    To everlasting day.
