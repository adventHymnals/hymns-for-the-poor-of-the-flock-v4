    1. O J esu s Christ, the Saviour,
    We only look to Thee;
    ’Tis in Thy love and favour 
    Our souls find liberty.
    While Satan fiercely rages,
    And shipwreck oft we fear,—
    'Tis this our grief assuages 
    That Thou art always near.

    2. Yes, tho’ the tempest round us
    Seems safety to defy;
    Tho’ rocks and shoals surround us, 
    And swell the billows high— 
    Thou dost from death protect us, 
    And cheer us by Thy love;
    Thy counsels too direct us 
    Safe to the Rest above.

    3. There—with what joy reviewing 
    Past conflicts, dangers, fears,
    Thy hand our foes subduing,
    And drying all our tears,—
    Our hearts with rapture burning, 
    The path we shall retrace, 
    Where now our souls are learning 
    The riches of Thy grace.

    4. O then how loud the chorus 
    Shall to Thy name resound, 
    From all at rest before us,
    From all Thy grace hath found 1 
    One joyful song for ever 
    Each harp, each lip shall raise, 
    The praise of our Redeemer,
    Our God and Saviour’s praise.
