    “No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth 
    and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church.” Eph. 
    v. 28, 29.
    When first, in purpose deep,
    The Church was brought to view,
    In God’s eternal mind,—
    (Though none His counsel knew),
    The Father gave her to the Son,
    And He betroth’d her for His own.

    2. And though in Adam’s loins
    She brake His holy word;
    And, treach’rously untrue,
    Departed from her Lord:
    He brought her back, though hell withstood, 
    Wash’d from her sins in His own blood.

    3. Part of that church are we,—
    Whom He did thus redeem,
    Learning by daily proof 
    Our daily need of H im;
    Taught by the Spirit to confess 
    Jesus our only righteousness.

    4. Yea, more,—to crown the whole
    (His gracious plan to prove),
    Our union, found in Christ,
    Nor earth nor hell can move;
    Our daily boast and song is this—
    Jesus is ours, and we are His.

    5. Yes! we are one with Him
    ’Mid all our lep’rous sta te;
    And who was ever yet 
    Fain his own flesh to hate?
    " One spirit with the Lord! ” this proves— 
    In loving us Himself He loves.

    6. Nor can He cease to love;
    For His own precept is,
    “Ye husbands love your wives,”—
    And will not Christ love His?
    Will not He cherish and refresh 
    Bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh?

    7. Ah, ye s! Christ loves the church 
    ’Tis her He lives to bless;
    He cannot love her more,
    Nor will He love her less:
    Fair in His sight, cleans’d by the word,
    A bride adorn’d, meet for her Lord.
