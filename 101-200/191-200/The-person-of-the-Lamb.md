    1. The person of the Lamb,
    Enfolding ev’ry grace,
    Once slain, but now alive again,
    In Heav’n demands our praise.

    2. Gladly of Him we sing,
    Since we with Him are dead;
    Our life is hid with Christ in God,
    In Christ the Church’s Head.

    3. A heav’nly calling this!
    It sounds thro’ earth abroad;
    For we, by faith, in H eav’n behold 
    The kingly priest of God.
