    1. W h i l e  we partake the bread and w ine,
    As emblems of Thy death,
    Lord, raise each soul above the sign, 
    To feast on Thee by faith.

    2. We do not come as strangers, Lord,
    Who only see the sign,
    l o r d ’ s  s u p p e r .
    But, as the objects of Thy love, 
    As sav’d by love divine.
