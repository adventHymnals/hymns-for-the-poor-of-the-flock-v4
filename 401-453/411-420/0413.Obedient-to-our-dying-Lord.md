    1. O b e d i e n t  to our d y i n g  Lord,
    Who bid us thus remember Him,
    O let us now surround His board,
    His flesh our food, His love our theme.

    2. Sweet fefist! here love and union reign,
    An earnest of the joys above ;
    And, meanest of the Saviour’s train,
    We celebrate His dying love.

    3. O may that love, by pow’r divine,
    To all our hearts be now made known; 
    Dear Saviour, on Thy people shine,
    The people Thou hast made Thine own.
