    1. In blessed union here we meet,
    We sit at the Redeemer’s feet,
    And eat the bread of heav’n ;
    How highly privileg’d are ive,
    And O how thankful should we be,
    To whom this grace is giv’n !

    2. To join in fellowship, how sweet,
    With those who in the Saviour meet,
    Enlighten’d from above!
    How excellent the pleasure is,
    That flows from such a feast as this,
    Where all are join’d in love.

    3. But if such joy is found to flow 
    From sacred fellowship below,
    Then what must heaven be ?
    Where all the Saviour’s friends shall meet, 
    And dwell in happiness complete, 
    Throughout eternity.
