    1. O t h e  matchless love of God;
    He hath bought the church with blood: 
    Jesus, her exalted Head,
    For her sigh’d, and groan’d, and bled.

    2. She deserv’d eternal pain,
    But the Lamb for her was slain;
    He endur’d the wrath of heav’n 
    That her sins might be forgiv’n.

    3. He invites us to this feast;
    Bids our souls His glories taste;
    And with pleasure keep in view,
    What He once for us went through.

    4. Hear Him speak, ye saved few 
    For this word is sent to you;
    You, the objects of His choice,
    Listen to the Saviour’s voice:

    5. “ This, my body is, and blood;
    Take, receive it, as your food;
    But, as oft as this ye do,
    Keep your m a rtyr’d Lord in view.

    6. “ View Him in the church’s place, 
    Overwhelm’d in deep disgrace: 
    Plung’d in horror’s dreadful flood, 
    Bearing all the wrath of God.

    7. “ Risen now, with wonder tell,
    He has vanquish’d death and hell: 
    Cancell’d all your sins with blood,
    And will bring you home to God.”

    8. Shortly He Himself will come,
    And will raise us to His throne;
    Where His glories He’ll display,
    Through a long and endless day.
