    “ This do in remembrance of me.”—Luke xxii. 19.

    1. B r e a k i n g  b r e a d  in  l o v e  to g e th e r ,
    As our Master bid us do,
    We have joy and profit, whether 
    Men approve the deed or no ;
    Sweet the seasons,
    When our Saviour meets us so.

    2. Love is cherish’d and augmented,
    While we keep our Saviour’s laws;
    And His people are contented 
    To forego the world’s applause:
    Should they suffer,
    Pain is sweet in such a cause.

    3. Saviour, hear Thy people praying,
    Hear us from Thy throne of grace;
    0  be here, Thy love displaying,
    Let Thy people see Thy face;
    ’Tis Thy presence 
    Renders sacred ev’ry place.
    lord’s s u p p er .

    4. Let us here have sweet communion 
    With each other and with Thee ; 
    Truth the sacred bond of union, 
    Truth that makes Thy people free ;
    Heav’n in prospect,
    Heav’n where saints Thy glory see.
