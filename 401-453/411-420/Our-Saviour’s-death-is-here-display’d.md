    1. Our Saviour’s death is here display’d.
    The death endur’d for us;
    On Jesus all our sin was laid,
    He bore it on His cross.

    2. And now in heav’n His people’s names
    Upon His breast appear ;
    For them eternal life He claims.
    Whose sin He cancell’d here.lord's s u p p e r .

    3. We hope with all the ransom’d crowd 
    Ere long to see His face ;
    To testify our joy aloud,
    In songs of endless praise.
