[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5gWwXKbOajjHb5dLz0_8KO7QM%2DoHbh0/edit?mode=html)



    1. I n fellowship we meet around
    The table of our Lord;
    Let joy and thankfulness abound,
    For faithful is His word.

    2. The people whom the Lord appoints
    The heirs of glory here;
    He saves, and by His grace anoints,
    And bids them nothing fear.

    3. The food they eat is meat indeed,
    The richest heav’n affords;
    The bread of God is living bread,
    His words are living words.

    4. Then let our thankful songs abound,
    Our privilege is great;
    Our Father’s table we surround,
    And eat of children’s meat.
