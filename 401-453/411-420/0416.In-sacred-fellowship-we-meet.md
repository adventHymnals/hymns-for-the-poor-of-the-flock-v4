    1. I n sacred fellowship we meet,
    To celebrate our Saviour’s death; 
    His blood we drink, His flesh we eat, 
    His people feed on Him by faith.

    2. How blest the people who are His!
    To them the bread of life is giv’n ;
    How fair, how rich their portion is ! ^
    They hope to see their Lord in heav n.

    3.  Till He appear, His death shall be
    Their spring of hope, their theme ot joy; 
    And when in heav’n their Lord they see, 
    His praise shall all their pow’rs employ.
