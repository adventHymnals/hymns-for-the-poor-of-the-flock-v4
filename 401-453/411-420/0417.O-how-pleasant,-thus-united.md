    1. 0 how pleasant, thus united,
    To surround the sacred board 1 
    While the hosts above, delighted,
    Sing the praises of our Lord;
    Let us join them ;
    Be the Saviour’s name ador’d.

    2. When He died, the cup was finish’d,
    That which He was call’d to take;
    Yes, He drank it undim inish’d,
    Drank it for His people’s sake;
    Jesus drain’d i t ;
    Nothing could His purpose shake.

    3.  Let us thank Him, let us praise Him,
    Let us sing, though well we know 
    Nought of our’s can ever raise Him,
    No, nor all that angels do;
    Yet His people
    Should confess how much they owe.
