    1. J esus, m y sorrow lies too deep
    For human ministry;
    It knows not how to tell itself 
    To any but to Thee.

    2. Thou dost remember still, amid
    The glories of God’s throne,
    The sorrows of mortality,
    For they were once Thine own.

    3. Yes, for as if Thou would’st be God,
    E’en in Thy misery,
    There’s been no sorrow but Thine own 
    Untouch’d by sympathy.

    4. Jesus, my fainting spirit brings
    It’s Tearfulness to Thee,
    Thine eye at least can penetrate 
    The clouded mystery.

    5. And is it not enough, enough,
    This holy sympathy ?
    There is no sorrow e’er so deep 
    But I may bring to Thee.
