    1. O God, Thy bounteous hand hath spread
    With earthly food our humble board, 
    And feeds our souls with sweeter bread, 
    The Bread of lifeâ€”our gracious Lord.

    2. Thy grace in all things soars above
    The sweetest song Thy saints can raise, 
    Yet, Lord, for this, and all Thy love 
    Accept our weak, unworthy praise.
