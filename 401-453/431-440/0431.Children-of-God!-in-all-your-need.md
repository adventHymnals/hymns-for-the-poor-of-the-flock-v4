    1. Children of God! in all your need,
    Remember Him Who died for you;
    Ye suppliants ! think, whene’er ye plead, 
    The Lord of Love is pleading too.

    2. Nor pleads in vain—the Father hears
    The voice of His beloved Son,
    ’Tis music in Jehovah’s ears:
    He pleads ; and lo, the suit is won.

    3.  “ Father, forgive them!” Jesus cried,
    When bleeding on the cursed tree—
    “ Bless, bless them, Lord, for this I died!” 
    Is now His all-prevailing plea.

    4.  Come, brethren, then, our feeblest pray’r,
    Perfum’d with Jesu’s blessed name,
    Is heard on high, is treasur’d there,
    And all that heav’n can give may claim.

    5.  From everlasting we are His,
    In love’s eternal counsel giv’n ;
    And He Himself our portion is,
    The glory of our promis’d heav’n.
