    1. Christian brethren, ere we part, 
    Ev'ry voice, and ev’ry heart
    One glad hymn to God should raise, 
    One high note of grateful praise.

    2. Here we all may meet no m ore;
    But there is a happier shore,
    Where, releas’d from toil and pain, 
    Brethren, we shall meet again.

    3. By the Spirit Who has won
    Us to God thro’ Christ the Son,
    Glad we raise the song again, 
    Hallelujah! and amen !
