    1. O nce more, before w e part,
    We’ll bless the Saviour’s name ; 
    Record His mercies, ev’ry heart;
    Sing, ev’ry tongue, the same.

    2. Hoard up His sacred word,
    And feed thereon, and grow;62, G3, 64
    PARTING.
    Go on still more to know the Lord 
    And practise what we know.
