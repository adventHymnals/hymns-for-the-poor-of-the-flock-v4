    1. Lord, now we part in Thy blest name,
    In which we here together came;
    Grant us our. few remaining days,
    To work Thy will, and spread Thy praise.

    2. Teach us, in life and death, to bless
    The Lord our Strength and Righteousness, 
    And grant us all to meet above,
    Where we shall ever sing Thy love!
