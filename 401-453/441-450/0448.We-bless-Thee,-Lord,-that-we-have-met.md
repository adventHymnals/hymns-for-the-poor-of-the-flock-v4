    1. We bless Thee, Lord, that we have met 
    Once more before Thy mercy-seat, 
    Thy ransom’d family, to raise
    In Jesu’s name our song of praise.

    2. And now Thy blessing we implore,
    To guard and keep us evermore;
    Into Thine hand our souls commend, 
    To guide, and strengthen, and defend.

    3. Through all the dangers of the night 
    Through the temptations of the light,PARTING.
    Through every snare, from every ill,
    Thou, Lord, shalt be our Saviour still.

    4. Once more, for all Thy love hath done, 
    Thy mercies past, or yet unknown ;
    For all Thy goodness, gracious Lord,
    For ever be Thy name ador’d !
