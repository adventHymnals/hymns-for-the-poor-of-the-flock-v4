    1. While to sev’ral paths dividing,
    We our pilgrimage pursue,
    May our Shepherd, safely guiding, 
    Keep His scatter’d flock in view! 
    May the bond of blest communion 
    Ev'ry distant soul embrace,
    ’Till in everlasting union,
    We attain our resting-place.PARTING.

    2. O ’tis sweet, each other aiding,
    In companionship to move,
    One desire each Heart pervading,
    One, our Lord, our faith, our love: 
    Sweet when each can bend, imploring 
    Soothing for his brother’s pain,
    And, the stumbling soul restoring, 
    Cheer him to the race again.
