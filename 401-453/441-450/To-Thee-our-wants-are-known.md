    1. To Thee our wants are known,
    From Thee are all our powers, 
    Accept what is Thine own,
    And pardon what is ou rs;
    Our praises, Lord, and prayers receive, 
    And to Thy word Thy blessing give.

    2. 0 grant that each of us,
    Now met before Thee here,
    May meet together thus,
    When Thou and Thine appear;
    And follow Thee to heav’n our home, 
    E’en so, Amen, Lord Jesus, come.
