    1. D ismiss us with Thy blessing, Lord ; 
    Help us to feed upon Thy word;
    All that has been amiss forgive,
    And let Thy truth within us live!

    2. Though we are guilty, Thou art good; 
    Wash all our works in Jesu’s blood; 
    Give ev’ry fetter’d'soul release,
    And bid us all, “ Depart in peace! ”
