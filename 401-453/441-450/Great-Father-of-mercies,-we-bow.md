    G reat Father of mercies, we bow 
    With thanks for our headship above ; 
    Nor less, Holy Jesus, art Thou 
    The object of praise and of love!
    In the three glorious persons in God, 
    (Whose sov’reignty all shall adore); 
    Through Christ, and by faith in His blood, 
    We’ll glory and boast evermore.
