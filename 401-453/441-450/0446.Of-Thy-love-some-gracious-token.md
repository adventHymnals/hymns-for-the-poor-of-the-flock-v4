    Of Thy love some gracious token 
    Grant us, Lord, before we g o ;
    Bless Thy word which has been spoken, 
    Life and peace on all bestow.
    When we join the world again,
    May our hearts with Thee remain:
    0  direct us,
    And protect us,
    Till we gain the heavâ€™nly shore,
    Where Thy people want no more.
