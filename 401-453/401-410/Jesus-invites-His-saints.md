    1. J esus invites His saints
    To meet around His board ;
    Here pardon’d sinners sit and hold 
    Communion with their Lord.

    2. Our heav’nly Father calls
    Christ and His members o ne;
    We the young children of His love,
    And He the first-born Son.

    3.  We are but sev’ral parts
    Of the same broken bread;
    'Our body hath its sev’ral limbs,
    But Jesus is the Head.

    4.  Let all our pow’rs be join’d,
    His glorious name to raise;
    Pleasure and love fill every mind,
    And ev’ry voice be praise.
