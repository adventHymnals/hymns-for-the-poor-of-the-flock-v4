    1. 0  how sweet, how com fortable,
    In th e wilderness to see 
    Rich provisions, and  a table 
    Spread fo r sinners, spread for m e!32 l o r d ’ s  s u p p e r .

    2. Here Thy bounty still partaking,
    In these signs of bread and wine,
    Freely all things else forsaking,
    I behold the Saviour mine.

    3. In His bruised body broken,
    In the shedding of His blood,
    See, my soul, a gracious token,
    Sure and full for ev’ry good.

    4. To His cross for refuge flying,
    Arm thee for the strife within;
    There, from Thy Redeemer dying,
    Learn the sinfulness of sin.

    5. Cleans’d, and wash’d, and freely pardon’d,
    By His matchless love and power;
    Hear Him say (no longer harden’d),
    “ Go in peace, and sin no more.”
