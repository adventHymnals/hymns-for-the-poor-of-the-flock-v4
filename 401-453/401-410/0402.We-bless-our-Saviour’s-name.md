[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CbNZyvPO43j1AZCKuQfTfLiMwDUIWUs1/edit?mode=html)



    1. We bless our Saviour’s name,
    Our sins are all forgiven;
    To suffer once to earth He came:
    He now is crown’d in heaven.

    2. His precious blood was shed,
    His body bruis’d for sin; 
    Remembering this, we break the bread, 
    And joyful drink the wine.

    3. While we remember Thee,
    Lord, in our midst appear;
    Let each by faith Thy body see,
    While we assemble here.

    4. We never would forget
    Thy rich, Thy precious love;
    Our theme of joy and wonder here,
    Our endless song above.

    5. O let Thy love constrain
    Our souls to cleave to Thee 1 
    And ever in our hearts remain 
    That word, Remember me.
