    1. Ours is a rich and royal feast,
    Provided by the King of heaven:
    How privileg’d are they, and blest,
    To whom the bread of life is given !

    2. In sacred fellowship we meet,
    To celebrate our Saviour’s death:
    His blood we drink, His flesh we ea t;
    His people feed on Him by faith.

    3. We worship Him Who bore the cross;
    We glory in His death alone:
    The world itself appears but loss 
    To those to whom His name is known.

    4. The blood He shed supplies a stream 
    That washes all our guilt away ;
    How precious, then, the Lord should seem, 
    Whose death we celebrate to-day!

    5. On earth His dying love shall be
    Our spring of hope, our theme of joy ;
    And, when in heaven our Lord we see,
    His praise shall all our pow’rs employ.
