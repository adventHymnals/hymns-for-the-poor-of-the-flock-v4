    1. B re t h r e n , come, our Saviour bids us—
    Bids us to a feast of love:
    Bless the Lord, Whose bounty feeds us 
    With .provision from above:
    Ye, for whom His life was given,
    " Come and eat the bread of heaven.

    2. Let us think of Him who bought u s ;
    ’Tis the Saviour’s own command: 
    When we wander’d, Jesus sought us ;
    Now He leads us by the hand—
    Now He gives us hope, and says,
    We shall sing His endless praise.

    3. O how much His people owe Him !
    O what love our Lord has shewn !
    Well may we surrender to Him 
    All that once we call’d our own.
    Lord, we give ourselves to Thee—
    Thou our Guide, our Master be !2 8,2 9
