[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CMR1NLuLr8wUkB1rP31eh8AscQElzjPZ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, once for sinners slain,
    From the dead was raised again;
    And in heav’n is now set down,
    Glorious on His Father’s throne.

    2. He has made an end of sin,
    And His blood has wash’d us clean;
    In our midst, assembled here,
    Jesus stands His saints to cheer.

    3. While we break the bread in faith,
    We shew forth our Saviour’s death;
    Bread thus broken aptly shews 
    How His body God did bruise.

    4. While by faith we drink the wine,
    Of His blood we see the sign;
    Precious blood ! so freely spilt,
    To redeem our souls from guilt.

    5. Lord, we thus remember Thee;
    But we long Thy face to see—
    Long to reach our heat’nly home.
    “ Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!”
