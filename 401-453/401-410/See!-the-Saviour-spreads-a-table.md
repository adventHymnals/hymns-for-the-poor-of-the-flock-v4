    1. See ! the Saviour spreads a table,
    And invites His friends to eat: 
    Surely none but He is able 
    To supply so rich a treat:
    ’Tis His body:
    Brethren, this indeed is meat.

    2. Come, and round His board assemble;
    Jesus bids you now draw near:
    Ye who hear His word and tremble, 
    Banish every servile fear:
    Come and witness 
    That the Lord Himself is here.

    3. Gracious Master! bless our meeting; 
    Grant us spiritual food,
    While the world is still repeating,
    “ Who will shew us any good?”
    On Thy people
    Shine from heaven Thy bright abode.
