    1. Our passover is offer’d up,
    The bread we break His body is;
    His blood was shed to fill the cup,
    And 0 was ever love like His !

    2. The Master of the feast has said,
    Be sure all leaven to remove;
    And keep it with th’ unleaven’d bread 
    Of truth, sincerity, and love.

    3. May we obey, and sweetly prove
    How blest they are who know His name; 
    And share at length, with those above,
    The wedding supper of the Lamb.
