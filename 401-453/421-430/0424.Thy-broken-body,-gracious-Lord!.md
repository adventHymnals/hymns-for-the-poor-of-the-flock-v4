[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWWBgnAw0eMa7eIMpfHswUCKUoL8PQKH/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy broken body, gracious Lord!
    Is shadow’d by this broken bread,
    The wine which in this cup is pour’d 
    Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.

    2. And while we meet together thus,
    We shew that we are one in Thee,
    Thy precious blood was shed for us,
    Thy death, 0 Lord, has set us free.

    3. Brethren in Thee, in union sweet,
    (For ever be thy grace ador’d),
    ’Tis in Thy name, that now we meet,
    And know Thou’rt with us, gracious Lord.

    4. We have one hope—that Thou wilt come,
    Thee in the air we wait to see,
    When Thou wilt take Thy people home,
    And wre shall ever reign with Thee.
