    1. T he s e  emblems of th e Saviour’s love,
    By faith may we receive;
    And with a solemn pleasure prove,
    That we in Him believe.

    2. No goodness of our own we bring;
    For we are vile and base;
    Christ is our all, of Christ we sing,
    And wait to see His face.

    3. As beggars poor, and blind, and mean,
    We rest on Christ alone:
    Thanks to the Lamb that once was slain— 
    The Lamb that did atone.

    4. Our sins are His (O bless His name!)
    His righteousness is our’s ;
    He saves from Satan, wrath, and sin,
    And all their frightful powers.

    5. Then let us each, with heart and tongue,
    Sing, “ Worthy is the Lamb !”
    To Him alone the praise belongs,
    And we ’ll adore His name.
    lord’s s u p p e r .
