    1. Se e ! the Father’s hand is spreading
    Manna in the wilderness:
    See! the Holy Ghost is shedding 
    Love, and joy, and peacefulness:
    To Himself, the lost, the vile—
    God in Christ doth reconcile.

    2. Till we knew this cup of blessing,
    Nothing for our souls sufficed:
    Here we rest, by faith possessing 
    Pardon through the blood of Christ. 
    Now we thirst for nought beside:
    All our wants are satisfied.

    3. While we share in sweet communion,
    While on Christ our souls are fed, 
    Here the world may see our union, 
    One the body—one the bread.
    Now we seek for nought beside, 
    Richly all our need supplied.

    4. In the heav’ns our Lord is seated,
    And His church is in Him there; 
    When on earth the Bride’s completed, 
    All His glory we shall share:
    But till He, our life, appear,
    Nought but suffering know we here.
