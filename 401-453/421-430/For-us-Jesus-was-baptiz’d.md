    1. F ob us Jesus was b a p tiz ’d 
    For us He was ag on iz’d ;
    Mighty vengeance, like a flood, 
    Overwhelm’d the Lamb of God.

    2. Come, ye saints, with wonder view 
    What the Lord has done for you;
    View the mighty waters roll,
    Breaking in upon His soul.

    3. View the swelling floods of wrath 
    Sinking Jesus into death;
    Grief Him cover’d like a grave,
    When He died your souls to save.

    4. This was baptism indeed;
    Well might mountains shake with dread; 
    Baptism serves in type to show,
    What our Lord did undergo.5 Sons of God, lift up your eyes; 
    See the martyr’d Saviour rise;
    He has conquer’d death and hell; 
    With Him you shall ever dwell.
