[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKY4qpVxALgY74aqv2iEYEYtLRjeES0Y/edit?mode=html)



    1. With Jesus in our midst
    We gather round the board; 
    Though many, we are one in Christ, 
    One body in the Lord.

    2. Our sins were laid on Him
    When bruis’d on Calvary;
    With Christ we died and rose again, 
    And sit with Him on high.

    3. Faith eats the bread of life,
    And drinks the living wine; 
    Thus we in love together knit,
    On Jesus’ breast recline.

    4.  Soon shall the night be gone,
    And we with Jesus reign;
    The marriage supper of the Lamb 
    Shall banish ev’ry pain.
