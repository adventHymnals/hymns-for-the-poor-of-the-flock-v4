    1. As sinners sav’d by grace,
    And made alive to God,
    Thy righteousness we would embrace,
    And tread the heav’nly road.

    2. Thy wisdom did ordain
    This solemn rite to show 
    How Thou wast plung’d in wrath and pain, 
    To save our souls from woe.

    3.  We come Thy name to own,
    And solemnly confess,
    Thou art our Life, our Joy, our Crown, 
    Our Strength and Righteousness.
