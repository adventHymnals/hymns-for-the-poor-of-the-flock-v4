    1. O ne baptism  we own,
    A sacred, solemn sign 
    Of what the Saviourâ€™s undergone, 
    To wash away our sin.

    2. His overwhelming pain,
    And burial w e see;
    His rising from the grave again, 
    To set His members free.

    3. He hid our guilt from view,
    And buried all our sin;
    And He ordained this way to show 
    That we are one with Him.

    4. Then here by faith we view,
    That Christians all are dead 
    To Satan, sin, and Moses too, 
    Through Christ their living Head.

    5. And rising from the flood
    Doth solemnly maintain 
    Their life is hid with Christ in God, 
    And they shall with Him reign.
