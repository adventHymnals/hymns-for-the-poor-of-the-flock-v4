    1. H oly Lamb, who Thee receive, 
    Who in Thee begin to liv e;
    Day and night they cry to Thee,
    “As Thou art, so let us be.”

    2. Fix, O fix each wavering mind,
    To Thy cross our spirits bind; 
    Earthly passions far remove, 
    Swallow up our souls in love.

    3. Dust and ashes though we be,
    Full of guilt and misery;
    Thine we are, Thou Son of God, 
    Take the purchase of Thy blood.

    4. Boundless wisdom, power divine, 
    Love unspeakable, are Thine; 
    Praise by all to Thee be given, 
    Sons of God, and hosts of heaven.2 4 2
