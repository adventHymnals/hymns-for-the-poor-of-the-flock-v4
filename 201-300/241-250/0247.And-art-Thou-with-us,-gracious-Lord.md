    1. And art Thou with us, gracious Lord,
    To dissipate our fear;
    Dost Thou proclaim Thyself our God,
    Our Father ever near?

    2. A father’s pity dost Thou feel
    For all Thy feeble sain ts;
    And in the tend’rest accents speak,
    To soothe their sad complaints?

    3. On this support our souls shall lean,
    And banish ev’ry care;
    The darkest path is cheer’d with smiles, 
    Since Thou art with us there.
