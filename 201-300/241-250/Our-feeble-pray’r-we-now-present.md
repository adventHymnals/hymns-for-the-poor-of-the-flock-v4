    1. Our feeble pray’r we now present
    Before the throne of grace;
    God of the fathers! be our guide 
    Through all the toilsome race.

    2. Through each perplexing path of life
    Our pilgrim footsteps guide;
    Save us each day from Satan’s wiles,
    And full escape provide.

    3. O spread Thine own protection round,
    Till all our wand’rings cease,
    And at our Father’s lov’d abode 
    We all arrive in peace!

    4. We ask through Him, by Whose kind hand
    Thine own were ever le d;
    Who in Thy presence stands confess’d,
    The Church’s glorious Head.
