    1. O teach me more of Thy blest ways,
    Thou Holy Lamb of G od!
    And fix and root me in Thy grace,
    As one redeem’d by blood.

    2. O tell me often of Thy love,
    Of all Thy grief and pain;
    And let my heart with joy confess, 
    From thence comes all my gain.

    3. For this, O may I freely count
    Whate’er I have but loss;
    The dearest object of my love, 
    Compared with Thee, but dross.

    4. Engrave this deeply on my heart
    With an eternal pen,
    That I may, in some small degree, 
    Return Thy love again.
