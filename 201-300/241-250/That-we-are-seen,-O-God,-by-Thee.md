    1. That we are seen, O God, by Thee,
    This is our happy thoug ht;
    Presented faultless to Thine eye,
    And all our sins forgot.

    2. Each hour of joy, this is the light
    Which guides us in our ways;
    And in affliction’s midnight gloom 
    This truth its pow’r displays.

    3. Then boldly on thro’ life we’ll pass;
    And if we’re call’d to die,
    The valley’s shade we will not dread, 
    For Thou wilt still be nigh.
