    1. Jestjs, spotless Lamb of God,
    Thou hast bought us with Thy blood— 
    We would value nought beside 
    Jesus—Jesus crucified.

    2. We are Thine—and Thine alone,
    This we gladly, fully ow n;
    And, in all our works and ways,
    Only now would seek Thy praise.

    3. Help us to confess Thy name,
    Bear with joy Thy cross and shame; 
    Only seek to follow Thee,
    Though reproach our portion be.


    4. When Thou shalt in glory come, 
    And we reach our heav’nly hom e; 
    Louder still each lip shall own, 
    We are Thine, and Thine alone.
