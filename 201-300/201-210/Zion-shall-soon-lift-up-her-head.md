    1. Zion shall soon lift up her head,
    And, call’d by grace, arise at length; 
    From dust, and darkness, and the dead, 
    Zion shall rise in Jesus’ strength—

    2. Shall put her beauteous garments on,
    Salvation, praise, and righteousness: 
    And, through the world her glory known, 
    The heathen shall her God confess.

    3. An earthly sun no more her light;
    The clouded moon conceals her face: 
    Jehovah sheds His glory bright 
    On all her scorn’d and sinning race.

    4. Then shall her gates wide open stand,
    And she the hallow’d court prepare;
    For Gentile hosts in Judah’s land 
    Shall swell her praise and join her pray’r
