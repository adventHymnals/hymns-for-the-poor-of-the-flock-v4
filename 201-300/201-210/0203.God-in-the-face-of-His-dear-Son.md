    1. God, in the face of His dear Son,
    Makes His eternal counsels known,
    There love in all its glory shines,
    And truth is drawn in fairest lines.

    2. The prisâ€™ner there may break his chains, 
    The weary rest from all his pains;
    The captive feel his bondage cease,
    The mourner find the way of peace.

    3. There faith reveals to mortal eyes 
    A brighter world beyond the skies;
    There shines the light which guides our way 
    From earth to realms of endless day.

    4. May we find grace to know the Lord,
    To seek His glories in the word;
    Its truths with meekness to receive,
    And by its holy precepts live.
