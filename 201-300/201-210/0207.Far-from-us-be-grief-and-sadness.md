    1. F a r from us be grief and sadness, 
    Farther still unhallow’d mirth; 
    Sons of God may sing with gladness, 
    Theirs are joys of heav’nly birth:
    Jesus owns them,
    He is Lord of heaven and earth.

    2. All the worldling’s mirth is madness,
    All his labour fruitless toil;
    ’Tis the saints that taste of gladness, 
    Tho’ the world their choice revile: 
    Sweet their portion,
    Life is in the Saviour’s smile.

    3. Once the world was all our treasure,
    Then the world our hearts possest; 
    Now we taste sublimer pleasure, 
    Since the Lord has made us blest: 
    We can witness,
    Jesus gives His people rest.
