    1. Well may we sing! with triumph sing
    The great Redeemer’s praise!
    The glories of the living God,
    Reveal’d in Jesu’s face.

    2. The Father’s love it was, that sought
    From Hell to set us free;
    That gave the Lamb, whose precious blood 
    Has seal’d our liberty.

    3. In Him we read the Father’s love,
    And find eternal peace;
    We meet our God in Jesus Christ,
    And fear and terror cease.

    4. Then gladly sing, and sound abroad
    The great Redeemer’s praise;
    The glories of the living God,
    The riches of His grace!
