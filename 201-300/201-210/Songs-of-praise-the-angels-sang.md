    1. Songs of praise the angels sang,
    Heav’n with hallelujahs rang,
    When Jehovah’s work begun,
    When He spake, and it was done.

    2. Songs of praise awoke the morn,
    When the Prince of Peace was b orn; 
    Songs of praise arose, when He 
    Captive led captivity.

    3. Heav’n and earth must pass away,
    Songs of praise shall crown the day: 
    God will make new heav’ns and earth, 
    Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

    4. And must man alone be dumb,
    Till that glorious kingdom come?
    N o;—the church is call’d to raise 
    Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.

    5. Let the church then spend her breath, 
    Singing of the Saviour’s death;
    And no less, with heart and voice,
    In the Lamb’s new life rejoice.

    6. Learning thus by faith and love,
    Songs of praise to sing above;
    Soon this holy sweet employ 
    She in glory shall enjoy.
