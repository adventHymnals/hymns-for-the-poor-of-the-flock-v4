    1. How bright these glorious spirits shine, 
    Whence all their bright array!
    How came they to the happy seats 
    Of everlasting day?272

    2. L o! these are they from suff’rings great,
    Who came to realms of light,
    And in the blood of Christ have wash’d 
    Their robes, which shine so bright.

    3. Now with triumphant palms they stand
    Before the throne on high;
    And serve the Lord they love, amidst 
    The glories of the sky.

    4. His presence fills each heart with joy,
    And gives them pow’r to sing;
    While day, and night, the sacred courts 
    With glad hosannas ring.

    5. Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
    Nor sun with scorching ray;
    God is their sun, whose cheering beams 
    Give them eternal day.

    6. The Lamb, Who dwells amid the throne
    Shall o’er them still preside,
    Feed them with nourishment divine,
    And all their footsteps guide.

    7. Midst pastures green He’ll lead His flock,
    Where living streams appear,
    And God the Lord, from ev’ry eye 
    Shall wipe off ev’ry tear.
