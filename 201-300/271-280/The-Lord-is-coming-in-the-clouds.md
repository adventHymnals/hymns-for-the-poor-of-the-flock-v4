    1. The Lord is coming in the clouds,
    Is coming with angelic crowds,
    An universal shout shall rend 
    The air, and Jesus will descend.

    2. How grand the pomp of His descent,
    What glory waits on the ev ent!
    The glory that to heav’n belongs,
    Is His, and His the angels’ songs.

    3. Unlike to those who nothing see 
    Beyond the world, those men should be, 
    Who look for Jesus in the air,
    And know that they shall meet Him there.

    4. Their girded loins, and lamps of fire 
    Should tell what is their souls’ desire,
    To see the object of their love,
    And dwell with Him in heav’n above.
