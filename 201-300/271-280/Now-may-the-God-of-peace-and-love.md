    1. Now may the God of peace and love,
    Who, from the silent grave,
    Restor’d the Shepherd of the sheep, 
    Omnipotent to save,—

    2. Through the rich merits of that blood
    Which He on Calv’ry spilt,
    To make the gracious work secure,
    On which our hopes are built,—

    3. Perfect our souls in ev’ry grace,
    To do His blessed will,
    And all that’s pleasing in His sight 
    Inspire us to fulfil.

    4. For Him, our ris’n Shepherd’s sake,
    We ev’ry blessing p ray;
    With glory let His name be crown’d 
    Through heav’n’s eternal day.
