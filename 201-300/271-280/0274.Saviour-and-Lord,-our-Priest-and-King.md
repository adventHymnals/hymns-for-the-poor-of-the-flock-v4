    1. Saviour and Lord, our Priest and King, 
    Who didst for our transgressions die, 
    Bearing our grief, that Thou miight’st bring 
    Pardon and immortality;

    2. Grant to our voice a seraph’s wing 
    To bear Thy praises up on high,
    Dominion, blessing, might, we’ll sing 
    To Thee, throughout eternity;
    Amen! Amen! Our God, Amen.
