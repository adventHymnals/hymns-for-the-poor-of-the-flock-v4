    1. Thou great Redeemer, precious Lamb 1
    We love to sing of Thee;
    No m usic’s like Thy charming name, 
    Nor half so sweet can be.

    2. O let us ever hear Thy voice
    To us in mercy speak;
    And in our Priest will we rejoice 
    Thou great Melchisedec!

    3. Our Jesus shall be still our theme,
    While in this world we stay;
    We’ll sing our Jesus’ blessed name,
    When all things else decay.

    4. When we appear upon the cloud,
    With all the favour’d throng,
    Then will we sing more sweet, more loud, 
    And Christ shall be our song.
