    1. It was for me the Lord did die,
    To clear me from all charge of sin;
    And, Lord, from guilt of crimson dye,
    Thy precious blood hath made me clean.

    2. And now Thy righteousness divine
    Is all my glory, all my trust;
    Nor will I fear, since that is mine,
    While Thou dost live, and God is just.
    f Clad in this robe how bright I shine! 
    Angels might covet such a dress; 
    Angels have not a robe like mine,
    A robe like Jesusâ€™ righteousness.
