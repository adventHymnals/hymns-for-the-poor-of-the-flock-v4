    1. Sons of God, now raise your songs; 
    Praise to Jesus Christ belongs; 
    Glory to the Saviour’s nam e;
    His the Victor’s crown and fame.

    2. Sore the strife, but rich the prize; 
    Precious in the Victor’s eyes:237
    G lorious is th e w o rk achieved—
    Satan vanquish’d, saints reliev’d.

    3. Sing we then the Victor’s praise, 
    Wondrous in His works and ways;
    Bid Him welcome to the throne,
    He is worthy, He alone.

    4. Soon, the crown upon His brow,
    Every knee to Him shall bow;
    While the full creation sings,
    “Lord of lords ” and “King of kings!”
