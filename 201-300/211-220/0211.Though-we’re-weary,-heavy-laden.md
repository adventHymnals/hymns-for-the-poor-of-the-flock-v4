    1. Though we’re weary, heavy-laden,
    Lost and ruin’d in the fall;
    God in Christ is our salvation,
    He to us is all in all:
    Not the righteous,
    Sinners Jesus came to call.

    2. And for us, though poor and wretched,
    (God’s redeeming love adore!)
    Jesus stands in heav’n a Saviour,
    Full of mercy join’d with pow’r;
    He is able,
    He is willing evermore.

    3. Conscience could not make us linger,
    Nor of fitness could we dream;
    All the fitness He requireth,
    Is that we have need of Him:
    Jesus gave us
    Free salvation in His name.

    4. See the Saviour high ascended,
    Pleads for us His precious blood; 
    On the Father’s grace depending,
    We, thro’ Him, the sons of God, 
    Trust in Jesus,
    Who alone the winepress trod.
