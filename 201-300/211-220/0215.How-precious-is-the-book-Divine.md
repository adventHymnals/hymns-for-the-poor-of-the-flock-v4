    1. How precious is the book Divine,
    By inspiration giv’n 1 
    As a bright lamp its doctrines shine,
    To guide our souls to heav’n.

    2. It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
    In this dark vale of tears;
    Life, light, and joy it still imparts,
    And quells our rising fears.

    3. This lamp, thro’ all the tedious night
    Of life, shall guide our w ay;
    ’Till we behold the clearer light 
    Of an eternal day.
