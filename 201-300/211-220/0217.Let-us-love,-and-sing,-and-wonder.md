    1. Let us love, and sing, and wonder—
    Let us praise the Saviour’s name;
    He has hush’d the law’s loud thunder, 
    He has quench’d mount Sinai’s flame; 
    He has wash’d us in His blood,
    He has brought us nigh to God.

    2. Let us love the Lord th at bought us,
    Pity’d us when enemies;
    Called us by His grace, and taught us, 
    Gave us ears, and gave us eyes;
    He has wash’d us in His blood,
    He presents our souls to God.

    3. Let us sing, though fierce temptation
    Threaten hard to bear us down;
    For the Lord, our strong salvation, 
    Holds in view the conqu’ror’s crown; 
    He Who wash’d us in His blood,
    Safe will bring us home to God.

    4. Let us wonder; grace and justice
    Join, and point to mercy’s store; 
    Christ hath died; in Him our tru st is;
    Justice smiles, and asks no m ore;
    He Who wash’d us in His blood,
    Has secur’d our way to God.
