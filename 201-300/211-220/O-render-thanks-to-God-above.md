[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1imxxJz71_oLFKxcNso5Qdi_895aYFn42/edit?mode=html)



1\. O render thanks to God above,\
The fountain of eternal love;\
Whose mercy firm through ages past\
Hath stood, and shall for ever last.\
\
2. The Father's changeless love we sing,\
Blest fountain! whence our comforts spring:\
How great the depth, how high it flows,\
No saint can tell, no angel knows.\
\
3. Its length and breadth no eye can trace,\
No thought explore the bounds of grace:\
The love which sav'd our souls from hell,\
Transcends a seraph's tongue to tell.
