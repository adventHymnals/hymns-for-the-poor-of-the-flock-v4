    1. Join’d in the bonds of faith and love, 
    W ith saints on earth and saints above,
    One Spirit with the Lord;
    In happy union here we meet,
    To worship at the Saviour’s feet,
    And own His work and word.

    2. Thy gracious presence, Lord, im part; 
    Display Thy pow’r in ev’ry heart,
    And shed Thy blessing round:
    O may Thy truth our spirits cheer, 
    Confirm our hope, dispel our fear,
    And make our joys abound.
