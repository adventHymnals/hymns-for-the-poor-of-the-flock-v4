    1. Hail! Alpha and Omega, hail!
    The First and Last to fa ith; 
    Securer of the Church’s hope,
    The Truth, the Life, the Path.214

    2. Hail! First and Last, the great I am,
    God of the world above 1 
    Increase each little spark of faith,
    Fill ev’ry saint with love.

    3. O let that faith which Thou hast taught,
    Be treasur’d in each breast;
    The evidence of joys unseen,
    The substance of our rest.

    4. Thus shall we go from strength to strength,
    From grace to greater grace;
    From each degree of faith move on,
    Till we behold Thy face.
