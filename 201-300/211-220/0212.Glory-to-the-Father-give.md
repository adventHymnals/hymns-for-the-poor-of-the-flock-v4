    1. Glory to the Father give,
    God in Whom we move and live; 
    Children’s praise He loves to hear, 
    Children’s songs delight His ear.

    2. Glory to the First-born bring,
    Christ the Prophet, Priest, and King 
    Brethren, raise your sweetest strain 
    To the Lamb Who once was slain!

    ~~3. Glory in the Holy Ghost,
    Sent from heav’n at Pentecost;
    ’Tis thro’ Him alone we live,
    And the precious truth receive.~~

    ~~4. May this then our service be, 
    Glorying in the Trinity,
    For the Gospel from above,
    For the word that “God is love.”~~
