    1. Joy to the world 1 the Lord is come! 
    Let earth receive her K ing;
    Let every heart prepare Him room, 
    And all creation sing.291

    2. Ye saints rejoice; the Saviour reigns!
    Let praise your tongues employ; 
    Floods, clap your hands; exult, ve plains, 
    And shout, ye hills, with joy!

    3. No more shall sins and sorrows grow,
    Nor thorns oâ€™erspread the ground;
    He comes to make His blessings flow,
    Far as the curse is found.

    4. Joy to the world! the Lord is come!
    Let earth receive her King;
    Let every heart prepare Him room,
    And all creation sing.
