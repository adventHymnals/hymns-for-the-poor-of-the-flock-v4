    1. Look, look, ye Saints, within the veil
    To Jesus raise your song,
    Your joys can never, never fail,
    For you to Him belong.

    2. O happy saints, for ever freed
    From guilt, and every care;
    Dwell, dwell with your exalted Head,
    And let your life be there.

    3. And glory in your conq’ring God;
    See, see Him as He is;
    Your robes are spotless through His blood, 
    Your happiness is His.

    4. O think not of this world of woe,
    Though subject I till to grief;
    But seek your portion there to know,
    For this will give relief.

    5. Aye trust, for ever trust in God,
    For ev’ry promise giv’n;
    And dwell with Him through Jesu’s blood, 
    Within the veil of heav’n.
