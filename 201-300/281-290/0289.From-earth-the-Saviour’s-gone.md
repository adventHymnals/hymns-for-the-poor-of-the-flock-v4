    1. From earth the Saviour’s gone,
    And stands before our God;
    And sprinkled now is all the throne, 
    With His atoning blood.

    2. No fiery vengeance now,
    No burning wrath comes down, 
    Where Justice calls for sinners’ blood, 
    The Saviour shews His own.

    3. Then may our joyful tongues
    Our Maker’s praises sing;
    Jesus, the Priest, receives our songs, 
    And bears them to the King.

    4. We bow before His face,
    And sound His glories hig h;
    “Hosanna to the God of grace,
    That brought the guilty nigh.”
