    1. W hy those fears? behold’tis Jesus 
    Holds the helm, and guides the ship; 
    Spread the sails, and catch the breezes 
    Sent to waft us through the deep,
    To the regions
    Where the mourners cease to weep.

    2. Could we stay where death is hovering? 
    Could we rest on such a shore?
    No; the awful truth discovering,
    We could linger there no m ore;
    We forsake it,
    Leaving all we lov’d before.

    3. Though the shore we hope to land on, 
    Only by report is known,
    Yet we freely all abandon,
    Led by that report alone,
    And with Jesus,
    Through the trackless deep move on.

    4. Led by that, we brave the ocean;
    Led by that, the storm defy;
    Calm amidst tumultuous motion, 
    Knowing that our Lord is nigh: 
    Waves obey Him,
    And the storms before Him fly.

    5. Render’d safe by His protection,
    We shall pass the wat’ry waste 
    Trusting to His wise direction,
    We shall gain the port at la st;
    And with wonder,
    Think on toils and dangers past.

    6. O what pleasures there await us!
    There the tempests cease to roar: 
    There it is that those who hate us 
    Can molest our peace no more: 
    Trouble ceases
    On th at tranquil, happy shore.
