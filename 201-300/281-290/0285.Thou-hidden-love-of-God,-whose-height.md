    1. Thou hidden love of God, Whose height, 
    Whose depth unfathomâ€™d no man knows, 
    I see from far Thy beauteous light,
    And gladly seek in it repose;
    That thus my heart from earth set free, 
    May find its whole delight in Thee!

    2. O crucify this self, that I
    No more, but Christ in me may liv e; 
    And bid each vile affection die,
    Nor let one hateful lust survive;
    In all things nothing may I see, 
    Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.
