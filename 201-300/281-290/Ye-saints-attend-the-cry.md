    1. Ye saints, attend the cry!
    Attend the trumpet’s sound: 
    Stand to your arms, the foe is nigh, 
    And pow’rs of hell are round.

    2. Consider Christ, your Head—
    Your Captain’s footsteps see; 
    Follow the Saviour, and be led 
    To certain victory.

    3. All pow’r to Him is giv’n—
    He ever reigns the same; 
    Salvation, happiness, and heav’n, 
    Are yours in Jesu’s name.

    4. Our Captain leads us on;
    He beckons from the skies;
    He reaches out the starry crown, 
    And bids us take the prize.288

    5. We bow to His command,
    Our arms and hearts prepare; 
    And firmly in the battle stand, 
    To wage a glorious war.
