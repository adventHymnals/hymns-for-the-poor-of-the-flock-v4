    1. Thou very present aid,
    In sufFring and distress,
    The soul, which still on Thee is staid, 
    Is kept in perfect peace.

    2. Calmly the heart reclin’d
    By faith on Jesu’s breast 
    In deepest woe exults to find 
    A sweet eternal rest.

    3. Jesus, to Whom we fly,
    Does all our wishes fill,
    In vain the creature-streams are dry, 
    We have a Fountain still.

    4. Bereav’d of earthly friends,
    We find them all in One!
    And peace, and joy, that never ends, 
    And heaven—in Christ alone!
