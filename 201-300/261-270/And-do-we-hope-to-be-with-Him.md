    1. And do we hope to be with Him,
    Who on the cross resign’d His breath, 
    Who died a victim to redeem 
    His people from eternal death?

    2. Then should the question oft recur,
    What do we more than others do?
    How do we show that we prefer 
    The things above to things below?

    3. Where is the holy walk that suits
    The name and character we bear?
    And where are seen those heav’nly fruits 
    That show we’re not what once we were?

    4. Allied to Him Who bore the cross,
    And call’d the people of the Lord,
    The world to us should seem but loss,
    And worthless all it can afford.

    5. As pilgrims on their journey home,
    ’Tis thus His people should be found, 
    Who seek a city yet to come,
    And cannot rest on earthly ground.

    6.’Tis thus His people prove their birth,
    ’Tis thus they glorify their Lord;
    To others they resign the earth,
    And hasten to their bright reward,
