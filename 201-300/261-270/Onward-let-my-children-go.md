    1. “Onward let My children go; ”
    Jesu’s God hath written so;
    Though the path be through the sea, 
    Little flock what’s that to thee?
    He Who bids thee pass the waters 
    Will be with His sons and daughters.

    2. Deep and wide the sea appears,
    Every soul is fill’d with fears—
    Yet the word is “Onward” still,—< 
    Forward move to do His will,
    Tho’ no way thou canst discover,
    Not one plank to float thee over.

    3. Art thou feeble, sorely tried?
    Art thou press’d on every side?
    Does it seem as if no pow’r 
    Could relieve thee in this hour?
    Wherefore art thou thus dishearten’d?
    Is the arm that sav’d thee, shorten’d?

    4. Stand thou still, and thou shalt see 
    Wonders wrought, and wrought for th ee; 
    Safe thyself, on yonder shore,
    Thou shalt see thy foes no more:264
    Thine to see the Saviour’s glory,
    Thine to tell a wondrous story.

    5. Trust thy Ged, and He’ll be known, 
    Far and wide, as God alone;
    At His feet thy fears shall fall,
    For thy God is Lord of a ll;
    Strength is His, and His salvation, 
    Make them both thy sure foundation.
