[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mfFdWNIa7EF3EpKLAT2QIp2WMaQGdfmY/edit?mode=html)



    1. To Thee, O gracious Lord, we give
    Our spirit, body, soul;
    Surcharge our hearts with love of Thee, 
    And baser loves control.

    2. Then will our converse be in heav’n,
    Thy praise our tongues employ;
    We shall forget all else but Thee,
    Our glory, crown, and joy.

    3. But oh 1 our Brother, Husband, Friend,
    We dread the things below,
    Lest they attempt to win our hearts, 
    And we our hearts bestow.

    4. Thou know’st us, fickle, foolish, frail,
    Inconstant as the air,
    Through Thee alone can we escape 
    Temptation’s constant snare.262

    5. Lord we look up, we turn to Thee,
    We seek Thy face above,
    Look, Lord, on us, and let us feel 
    Th’ omnipotence of love.
