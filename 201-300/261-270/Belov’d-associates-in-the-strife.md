    1. Belov’d associates in the strife
    That ends in perfect peace,
    A life of conflict is our life,
    FrtPtn war we must not cease.

    2. The soldiers of the cross must fight,
    Till life itself be p as t;
    The foe assails them day and night, 
    Assails them to the last.

    3. But let us still remember this,
    Though mighty are our foes,
    The Lord Who saves us, greater is 
    Than all who can oppose.

    4. We need not fly, we need not fear,
    Since He Who reigns above,
    In all our conflicts will be near 
    The people of His love.

    5. If thus we face the adverse pow’rs,
    If thus we meet the strife,
    The vict’ry always must be ours,
    And ours the crown of life.
