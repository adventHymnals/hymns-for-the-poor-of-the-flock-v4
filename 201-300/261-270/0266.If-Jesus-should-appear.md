    1. If Jesus should appear
    Now at this very moment,
    We have no cause to fear;
    No, but with deep abasement, 
    Joyful we would adore 
    The Lamb Who shed His blood, 
    And own Him evermore 
    Our Saviour, Lord and God.

    2. A h! might the time soon come,
    When Thou, our souls’ Belov’d, 
    Shalt take Thy brethren home,
    And shew them all approv’d; 
    When we shall all behold 
    Him Whom by faith we know, 
    Chief Shepherd of the fold,
    Saviour from ev’ry foe!

    3. Hear Thou Thy people’s cry,
    O Jesus, Christ and Lord,
    And bring that glory nigh 
    As promis’d in Thy w ord;
    And when Thou shalt assign 
    His lot to ev’ry one,
    Thy righteousness divine 
    Shall be our boast alone.
