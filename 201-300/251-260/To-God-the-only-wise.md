    1. To God, the only wise,
    Father, and Son, we sing,
    And high enthron’d above the skies, 
    Praises to Them we bring.

    2.’Tis God’s eternal love,
    His counsel and His care,
    Preserve us safe from sin and shame, 
    And ev’ry hurtful snare.

    3. He will present His saints,
    Unblemish’d and complete,
    Before the glory of His face,
    With Him enthron’d to sit.

    4. Then all His chosen seed
    Shall meet around the throne,
    To bless the triumph of His grace, 
    And make His glories known,

    5. To our Redeemer, God,
    Almighty pow’r belongs;
    We soon shall reach His bless’d abode, 
    And shout triumphant songs.
