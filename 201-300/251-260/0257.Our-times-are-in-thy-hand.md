    1. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Father, we wish them there;
    Our life, our soul, our all, we leave 
    Entirely to Thy care.

    2. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Whatever they may be,
    Pleasing or painful, dark or bright, 
    As best may seem to Thee.

    3. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Why should we doubt or fear?
    A Father’s hand will never cause 
    His child a needless tear.258

    4. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Jesus the crucified!
    The hand our many sins had pierc’d 
    Is now our guard and guide.

    5. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Jesus the Advocate!
    Nor can that hand be stretch’d in vain, 
    For us to supplicate.

    6. Our times are in Thy hand;
    We’ll always trust in Thee,
    Till we have left this weary land,
    And all Thy glory see.
