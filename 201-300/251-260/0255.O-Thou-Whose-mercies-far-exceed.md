    1. O Thou, W hose mercies far exceed
    All we can do or say,
    As in Thy people Thou indeed 
    Dost daily more display;
    Let, for our happiness, O God,
    On us while here below,
    By virtue of Thy death and blood,
    Thy richest blessings flow.

    2. Preserve Thy flock most graciously,
    Within Thy shelt’ring fold,
    Move them from ev’ry harm away,
    And in Thy safeguard hold;
    Till Thou shalt fully have obtain’d 
    In us the fruits of grace,
    And we, in joys that never end,
    Shall see Thee, face to face.

    3. O may the very God of peace,
    Us wholly sanctify,
    And grant us such a rich increase 
    Of unction from on high;
    That spirit, soul, and body may, 
    Preserved free from stain,
    Be blameless until Thy great day; 
    Lord Jesus Christ, Amen!
