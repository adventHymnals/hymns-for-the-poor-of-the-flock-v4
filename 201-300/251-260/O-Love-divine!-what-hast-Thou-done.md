[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nESIp2RbFOsEEALgpPe2NWo7O9jjqAYr/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Love divine! what hast Thou done?
    The Son of God His blood hath shed, 
    The Father’s co-eternal Son 
    Had all our sins upon Him laid;
    The Son of God for us hath died,
    Our Lord, our Life was crucified,—

    2. Was crucified for us in shame,
    To bring us, rebels, back to God;
    So we may glory in His name,
    For we are cleansed by His blood: 
    Pardon and life flow’d from His side, 
    When He, the Lord, was crucified.

    3. Then let us glory in the cross,
    And make it here our constant them e; 
    All things for Christ account but dross, 
    And give up all our hearts to Him.
    Of nothing speak or think beside,
    The Lord, Who here was crucified.
