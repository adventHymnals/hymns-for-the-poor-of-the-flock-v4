    1. T he Lamb was slain! let us adore,
    And joyfully His mercy own,
    And humbly now and evermore 
    Before His wounded feet fall down;
    Serve without dread, with rev’rence love 
    The Lord Whose boundless grace we prove.

    2. The Lamb was slain! both day and night
    The angelic choirs His praises sing;
    To Him enthron’d above all height,
    They round the throne their anthems bring; 
    As saints on earth we join the song,
    And praise Him tho’ with stamm’ring tongue.

    3. Gladly our own poor works we leave,
    For Him despise wealth, pleasure, fame, 
    To Him our souls and bodies give,
    Whose love doth our affections claim; 
    Henceforth we own Him as our Lord,
    Alone belov’d—alone ador’d.

    4. Through Him alone we live, for He
    Hath drowned our transgressions all 
    In love’s unfathomable sea:
    O love, unknown, unsearchable!
    The holy Lamb for sin was slain,
    That sinners endless life might gain.

    5. As ground, when parch’d with summer’s heat, 
    Gladly drinks in the welcome show’r,
    So would we, list’ning at His feet,
    Receive His words, and feel His pow’r; 
    Let nothing in our hearts remain 
    But this great truth, “The Lamb was slain! ”
