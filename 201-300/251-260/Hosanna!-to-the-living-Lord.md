    1. Hosanna! to the living Lord;
    Hosanna! to th’ incarnate Word;
    To Christ, Creator, Saviour, King,
    Let earth, let heav’n, hosanna sing!

    2. Hosanna! Lord, Thine angels cry, 
    Hosanna! Lord, Thy saints reply;
    Above, beneath us, and around,
    We would that all should swell the sound.

    3. Assembled in Thy blessed name.
    Here we Thy parting promise claim, 
    Then, Saviour, with protecting care 
    Present to God our praise and prayer.
