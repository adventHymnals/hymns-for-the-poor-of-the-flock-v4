    1. Sweet to the saints it is to bring 
    Praise to Thy name, O God, and sin g;
    To show Thy love by morning light,
    And tell of all Thy truth by night.

    2. For they must triumph in Thee, Lord,
    And bless Thy works, and bless Thy word: 
    To them Thy works so brightly shine!
    So deep Thy counsels! so divine!

    3. But if the little they can know 
    Of Thee and Thine while here below, 
    Such triumph givesâ€”what will it be 
    When face to face Thyself they see?
