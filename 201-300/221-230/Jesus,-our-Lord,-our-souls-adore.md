[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lk055HZS_2lpUAXr3iRkrDaNfevd9uqQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, our Lord, our souls adore 
    Thy saving love, Thy saving power;
    And, to our utmost stretch of thought, 
    Hail the redemption Thou hast wrought.

    2. Perish each thought of human pride;
    Let God alone be magnified;
    His glory let the heav’ns resound, 
    Shouted from earth’s remotest bound'

    3. Saints, who above the glory know!
    And ye who taste His love below 1 
    And every angel join to raise 
    Harmonious and eternal praise.
