    1. Let saints on earth their anthems raise, 
    Who taste the Saviour’s grace;229
    While they in heav’n proclaim His praise, 
    And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

    2. Praise Him Who laid His glory by,
    For man’s apostate race;
    Praise Him Who stoop’d to bleed and die, 
    And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

    3. We soon shall reach the blissful shore,
    And view His lovely face;
    His name for ever to adore,
    And own Him “Prince of Peace.”
