    1. Come, saints, and sing; dismiss your fear,
    And raise each drooping h ead;
    Come sing with all the ransom’d here 
    The Lamb that once was dead; 
    Salvation sing: no word more meet 
    To join to Jesus’ name!
    Let ev’ry thankful tongue repeat 
    Salvation to the Lamb!

    2. When we incurr’d the wrath of God,
    (Alas, what could we worse!)
    He came, and with His own life’s blood, 
    Redeem’d us from the curse:
    Salvation sing; no word more meet 
    To join to Jesus’ nam e!
    Repeat, ye ransom’d souls, repeat 
    Salvation to the Lamb!
