    1. Of all the gifts Thy hand bestows,
    Thou Giver of all good!
    Not heaven itself a richer knows 
    Than the Redeemerâ€™s blood.

    2. Faith, too, the blood-receiving grace,
    From the same hand we gain;
    Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
    The gift had been in vain.

    3. We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
    To Thee our all we owe;
    The precious Saviour, and the power 
    That makes Him precious too.
