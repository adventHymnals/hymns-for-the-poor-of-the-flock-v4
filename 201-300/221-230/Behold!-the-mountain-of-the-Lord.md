    1. Behold! the mountain of the Lord
    In latter days shall rise,
    On mountain tops above the hills,
    And draw the wond’ring eyes.

    2. To this the joyful nations round,
    All tribes and tongues, shall flow;
    “Up to the hill of God,” say they,
    “And to His house we’ll go.”

    3. The beam that shines from Sion’s hill,
    Shall lighten ev’ry land;
    The King who reigns in Salem’s tow’rs 
    Shall all the world command.

    4. Among the nations He shall judge;
    His judgments truth shall guide:
    His sceptre shall protect the just,
    And quell the sinner’s pride.

    5. No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds
    Disturb those peaceful years;
    To plough-shares men shall beat their swords, 
    To pruning-hooks their spears.2 24

    6. No longer hosts encount’ring hosts,
    Shall crowds of slain deplore; 
    They hang the trumpet in the hall, 
    And study war no more:—

    7. For now, O Israel, thou art call’d
    To worship at His shrine;
    And, walking in the light of God,
    In all His grace to shine.
