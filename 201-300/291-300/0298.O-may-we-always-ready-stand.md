    1. O may we always ready stand,
    With our lamps burning in the hand;
    May we in sight of heaven rejoice,
    Until we hear the Bridegroom's voice!

    2. Shine on us, Lord; new life im part;
    Fresh ardour kindle in each he art:
    And make Thine own all-quickâ€™ning light 
    Dispel the sloth and clouds of n igh t!
