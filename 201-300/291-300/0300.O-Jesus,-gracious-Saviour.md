    1. O Jesus, gracious Saviour,
    Upon the Father’s throne,
    Whose wond’rous love and favour 
    Have made our cause Thine own; 
    Thy people to Thee ever 
    For grace and help repair,
    For Thou they know wilt never 
    Refuse their griefs to share.

    2. O Lord, through tribulation
    Our weary journey lies,
    Through scorn and sore temptation, 
    And watchful enemies;
    ’Midst never-ceasing dangers 
    We through the desert roam,
    As pilgrims here and strangers,
    We seek the rest to come.

    3. O Lord, Thou too once hasted
    This weary desert through,
    Once fully tried and tasted 
    Its bitterness and woe;
    And hence Thy heart is tender,
    In truest sympathy,301
    Though now the heavens render 
    All praise to Thee on high.

    4. O by Thy Holy Spirit 
    Reveal to us Thy love,
    The joy we shall inherit
    With Thee, our Head above:
    May all this consolation
    Our trembling hearts sustain— 
    Sure—though through tribulation— 
    The promis’d rest to gain.
