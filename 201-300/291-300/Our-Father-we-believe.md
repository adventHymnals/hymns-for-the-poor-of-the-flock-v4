    1. Ouk Father! we believe,
    And trust Thy firm resolve:
    The Son has surely done the work,
    That did on Him devolve.

    2. His work is all complete—
    Salvation is secure:
    The merits of His life and death,
    Eternally endure.

    3. The proof is fix’d in heaven,
    High on Thy glorious thron e;
    For Jesus sits beside Thee now,
    Because Thy will is done.
