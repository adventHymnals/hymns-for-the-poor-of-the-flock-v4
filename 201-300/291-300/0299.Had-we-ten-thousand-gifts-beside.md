    1. H ad we ten thousand gifts beside,
    Weâ€™d cleave to Jesus crucified,
    And build on Him alone;
    For no foundation is there given,
    On which to place our hopes of heaven, 
    But Christ, the corner-stone.

    2. Possessing Christ, we all possess, 
    Wisdom, and strength, and righteousness,
    And sanctity complete.
    Bold in His name, we dare draw nigh, 
    Before the Ruler of the sky,
    And all His justice meet.
