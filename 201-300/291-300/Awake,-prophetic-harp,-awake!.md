[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khlOOH7z3CHwfIHjqkcFCFmCJUOYM4DR/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, prophetic harp, awake!
    Retune thy strings for Jesus’ sake;
    We sing the Saviour of our race,
    The Lamb, our shield and hiding-place.

    2.’Tis He, the Lamb, to Him we fly, 
    W’hile the dread tempest passes b y;
    God sees His Well-beloved’s face,
    And spares us in our hiding-place.

    3. Thus, while we dwell in this blest scene, 
    The Lamb is our unfailing screen;
    To Him, though guilty, still we run, 
    And God still spares us for His Son.

    4. While yet we sojourn here below,
    Pollutions still our hearts o’erflow;
    A fali’n, abject, sentenc’d race,
    We deeply need a hiding-place.

    5. But pure, immortal, sinless, free,
    We, through the Lamb, at length shall b e; 
    Shall meet the Father face to face,
    And need no more a hiding-place.
