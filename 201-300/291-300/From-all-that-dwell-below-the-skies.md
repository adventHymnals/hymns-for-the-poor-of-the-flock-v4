    1. From all that dwell below the skies,
    Let the Creator’s praise arise;
    Let the Redeemer’s name be sung,
    Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue.

    2. Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord!
    Eternal truth attends Thy W ord;
    Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
    ’Till suns shall rise and set no more.
