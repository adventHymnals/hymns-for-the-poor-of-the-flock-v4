1. O Saviour, we are Thine
In everlasting bands;
Our names, our hearts, we would resign 
Into Thy gracious hands.

2. To Thee we now would cleave
With firm and faithful zeal,
Though often press’d Thy paths to leave, 
Oh let not sin prevail!

3. Our lives we’d gladly lose
As not our own but Thine;
For Thee the tempter’s wiles refuse,
And all the world resign.

4. Let nothing from us hide
The glory of Thy day,
But keep us ever near Thy side 
Through all life’s gloomy way.

5. Since Thou and we are one,
We know we need not fear;
If Thou in heav’n hast fix’d Thy throne 
We too are fixed there.
