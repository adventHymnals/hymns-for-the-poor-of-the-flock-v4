####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Father, we commend our spirits
To Thy love in Jesu’s name,
Love, which His atoning merits 
Give us confidence to claim.

2. O how sweet, how real a pleasure
Flows from love so true and free! 
O how great, how rich a treasure, 
Saviour, we possess in Thee!

3. From the world and its confusions
Here we turn and find our rest,
From its care and its delusions,
Turn to Thee, and there are blest.

4. Though this scene is ever changing,
Since Thy mercy changes not,
O’er the waste our spirits ranging 
Glory in their happy lot.

5. By the Holy Ghost anointed,
May we do our Father’s will,
Walk the path by Him appointed,
Jesu’s pleasure to fulfil.

6. Till the welcome signal hearing,
Welcome to the saints alone,
We rejoice at His appearing,
Who shall claim us for His own.
