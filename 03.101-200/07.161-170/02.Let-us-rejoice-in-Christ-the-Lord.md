1. Let us rejoice in Christ the Lord,
Who claims us for His own;
The hope th a t’s built upon His word, 
Can ne’er be overthrown.

2. Though many foes beset us round,
And feeble is our arm,
Our life is hid with Christ in God 
Beyond the reach of harm.

3. Weak as we are, we shall not faint,
Or, fainting, cannot fail;
Jesus, the strength of ev’ry saint,
Must in the end prevail

4. Though now He’s unperceiv’d by sense,
Faith sees Him always near,—
A guide, a glory, a defence,
To save from ev’ry fear.

5. As surely as He overcame,
And conquer’d death and sin,
So surely those that trust His name 
Will all His triumph win.
