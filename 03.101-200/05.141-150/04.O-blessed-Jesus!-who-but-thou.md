####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O b l e s s e d Jesus! who but Thou,
On earth, in heav’n above,
May claim from all our willing hearts 
The full response of love?

2. We love the brethren, Lord,’tis true,
But O in them we see 
Sweet traces of Thy blessed self,
For they are one with Thee.145

3. And one with us—bu t O’twas thine
Thine only, Lord, to part 
With life, and all that love could give, 
To win the wand’ring heart.

4. Thus, heirs of endless bliss with Thee,
We love Thee—we adore—
Ah! give us all still greater grace 
To love Thee more and more!
