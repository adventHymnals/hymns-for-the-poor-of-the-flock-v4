####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Brightness of the Father’s glory,
Shall Thy praise unutter’d lie?
Who would hush the boundless story, 
Of the Lamb Who came to die;

2. Came from off the throne eternal,
Down to Calv’ry’s depth of woe, 
Came to crush the pow’rs infernal?— 
Streams of praises ceaseless flow!

3. Sing the Lamb’s triumphant rising;
Sing Him on the Father’s throne;148—14 9
Sing—till heav’n and earth surprising, 
Reigns the Nazarene alone.
