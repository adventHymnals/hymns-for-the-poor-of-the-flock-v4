####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. All things that God or man could wish,
In Jesus richly meet;
Not to our eyes is light so dear,
Or friendship half so sweet.

2. O may His Name still cheer our hearts,
And shed its fragrance there!
The sweetest balm of ev’ry wound,
The cure of ev’ry care.
