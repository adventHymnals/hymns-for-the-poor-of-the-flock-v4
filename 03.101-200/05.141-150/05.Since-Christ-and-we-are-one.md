####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Since Christ and we are one,
Why should we doubt or fear?— 
He sits upon the Father’s throne, 
And in Him we are there.

2. The Spirit doth unite
Our souls to Him our Head, 
And forms us to His image bright 
While we His footsteps tread.

3. And grace it is—free grace—
Which keeps us on the road,
Till we behold the Saviour’s face, 
And city of our God.
