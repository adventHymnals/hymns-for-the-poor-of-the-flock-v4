####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Jesus, the Christ! eternal W ord! 
Of all creation Sovereign Lord!
On Thee alone, by faith we rest;
And lean our weakness on Thy breast.

2. Thy blood hath wash’d us from our sin; 
Thy Spirit sanctifies w ithin!
And Thou for us, in all our need,
At God’s right hand dost ever plead.

3. O keep us in the narrow way,
That ne’er from Thee our footsteps stray: 
Sustain our weakness; calm our fear;
And to Thy presence keep us near.

4. And be it thus till th at blest day,
When God shall wipe all tears away.
" Quickly”—’tis promis’d in the word; 
E’en so. Amen. Come quickly, Lord!
