1. How blest the bright morning appears,
When Jesus reviv’d from the grave!
To banish for ever our fears,
To triumph, almighty to save.
How strong were His tears and His cries 1 
The worth of His blood how divine 1 
How perfect His one sacrifice,
Who rose, though He suffer’d for sin!

2. The Man, Whose mock-crown was of thorn,
Whom sinners agreed to deride,
The M an, Who bore scourging and scorn, 
The Man, Who on Calvary died,
Now blessed for ever is made,
And life has rewarded His pain;
Now glory encircles His head,
Heav’n sings of the Lamb that was slain.

3. And lo! when He cometh again,
His foes shall be clothed with shame;
But gladness the saints shall obtain,
And glory, and peace, with the Lamb. 
Then let us look forward to this,
And joyfully take up His cross:
As saints we shall be where He is,
And all that we lose is but dross.
