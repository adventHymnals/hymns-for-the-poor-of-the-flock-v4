1. From Egypt lately freed,
By the Redeemer’s grace,
A rough and thorny path we tread.
To see Him face to face

2. The promis’d rest and peace
Are still in constant view;
How difFrent to the wilderness 
We now are passing through!

3. Here grief, and care, and pain,
And fears distress us sore;
But there celestial pleasures reign,
And we shall weep no more.
