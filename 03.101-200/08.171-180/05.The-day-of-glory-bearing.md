####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. The day of glory bearing
Its brightness far and near,
The day of Christ’s appearing 
We now no longer fear;

2. He once a spotless victim
For us on Calv’ry bled; 
Jehovah did afflict Him,
And bruis’d Him in our stead.

3. But now H e’s interceding
For us who on Him r est;
And grace from Him proceeding, 
Tells us in Him we’re blest.

4. Then let Him come in glory,
Who comes His saints to raise, 
To perfect all the story 
Of wonder, love, and praise.
