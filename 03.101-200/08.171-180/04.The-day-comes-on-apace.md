1. The day comes on apace,
Soon shall the night be past:
Who trust the Saviour’s grace 
Shall see His face at last;
The clouds that now obstruct their sight, 
Shall quickly all be put to flight.

2. Ye saints, lift up your heads,
Salvation draweth nigh;
See where the morning spreads 
Its radiance through the sky;
O let the sight your spirits cheer!
The Lord Himself will soon appear.

3. Though men your Hope deride
(Nor will e’en God believe),
Do you in Him confide,
Whose word can ne’er deceive;
When heav’n and earth shall pass away, 
The saints shall see a glorious day.

4. For you the Lord intends
A bright abode on high,
The place where sorrow ends,
And nought is known but joy;
With such a hope, ye saints, rejoice,
Ye soon shall hear th’ archangel’s voice.
