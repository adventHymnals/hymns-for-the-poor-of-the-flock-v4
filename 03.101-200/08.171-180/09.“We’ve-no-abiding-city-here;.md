## 179. “We’ve no abiding city here;
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. “We’ve no abiding city here
This may distress the worldling’s mind, 
But should not cost the saint a tear,
Who hopes a better rest to find.

2. “W e’ve no abiding city here
Sad thought 1 were this to be our home 
But let this truth our spirits cheer,
We seek a city yet to come.

3. “W e’ve no abiding city here
Then let us live as pilgrims do;
Let not the world our rest appear,
But let us haste from all below.

4. “W e’ve no abiding city here
We seek a city out of sight,
Jerusalem! faith sees it near,
Brilliant with everlasting light.
