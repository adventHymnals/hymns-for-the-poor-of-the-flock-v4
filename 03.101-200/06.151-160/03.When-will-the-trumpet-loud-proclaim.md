1. When will the trumpet loud proclaim 
The judgment of the martyr’d Lamb? 
When will the captive saints be free, 
And keep th’ eternal jubilee?

2. O Father, let that day appear,
The promis’d Great Sabbatic Year;
When freed from sin, and toil, and pain, 
Thy ransom’d shall in glory reign.

3. Till then we cannot let Thee rest,
But still repeat our strong request;
And this our constant cry shall be,
Lord, sound the trump of jubilee.
