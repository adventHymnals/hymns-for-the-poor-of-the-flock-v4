```txt
1. O Thou Who didst Thy glory leave, 
Apostate sinners to retrieve 
From nature’s deadly fall;
As Thou hast bought us with a price, 
Our sins against us ne’er can rise, 
For Thou hast borne them all.

2. We sing One smitten in our stead, 
Him Who without the city bled
To expiate our stain;
Who, God of God, vouchsaf’d to dwell 
In flesh, to make of full avail 
The sufFrings of the man.

3. See Him for our transgressions giv’n, 
See the incarnate God of heav’n,
For us, His foes, expire;
Rejoice! rejoice! the tidings hear!
He bore, that we might never bear,
His Father’s righteous ire.

4. Ye saints, “the Man of sorrows” bless, 
The Lord, for your unrighteousness
Deputed to atone;
Praise, till with all the ransom’d throng 
Ye sing the never-ending song,
And sit upon His throne!
