1. It hath not fully yet appear’d
What blessedness to saints is giv’n; 
No eye hath seen, no ear hath heard, 
No heart conceiv’d the joy of heav’n.153

2. The mind of God, and it alone,
The joy prepar’d hath understood;
"When saints shall know as they are known, 
And shall behold the face of God—

3. The face of Him, Who here below
Appear’d, and died to save His own;
The same Who dwells in glory now,
And sits upon the Father’s throne.

4. The sight of Him His saints shall fill
With transport never known before;
They’ll feel no want, and fear no ill,
Nor sin nor sorrow any more.

5. Then blest our lo t! for we are His,
And we shall dwell with Him above;
Yea, we shall see Him as He is,
The Lord of grace, of truth, and love.
