1. And art Thou, gracious Master, gone,
A mansion to prepare for me?
Shall I behold Thee on Thy throne,
And there for ever sit with Thee? 
Then let the world approve or blame,
I’ll triumph in Thy glorious name.

2. Should I, to gain the world’s applause,
Or to escape its harmless frown, 
Refuse to countenance Thy cause,
And make Thy people’s lot mine own, 
W hat shame would fill me in that day 
When Thou Thy glory shalt display!

3. N o; let the world cast out my name,
And vile account me, if they will;155
If to confess my Lord be shame,
I purpose to be viler still;
For Thee, my God, I’d all resign,
Content th at I can call Thee mine.

4. For ah! what joy will fill my heart,
When Thou my worthless name shalt own, 
When I shall see Thee as Thou art,
And know as I myself am known:
When I, from sin and sorrow free,
Shall like my Lord for ever be.
