1. Y e watchful saints, arise!
Quick, from the dead awake!
Unto salvation wise,
Oil in your vessels take;
Awake 1 and hear the midnight cry,
“Behold the heav’nly Bridegroom nigh.”

2. He comes, He comes to call
The nations to His bar,
And raise to glory all 
Who call’d to glory a re;
Make ready for your full reward,
And go with joy to meet your Lord.

3. To meet Him in the sky,
Your everlasting Friend; —
Your Head to glorify,
With all His saints,—ascend; 
There see the Saviour face to face* 
And sing for ever of His grace.

4. Brethren, this is our hope
(Let it to all be known),
That we shall be caught up 
To share the Saviour’s throne, 
Call’d to partake the marriage feast, 
Though of all saints the very least.

5. Then let us wait to hear
The trumpet’s welcome sound; 
That when the Lord appear, 
Watching may we be found! 
Cloth’d in the righteousness divine, 
In which His Bride shall ever shine.
