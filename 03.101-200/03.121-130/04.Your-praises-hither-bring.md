1. Your praises hither bring,
Your Lord, ye saints, adore;
Let us give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore.
Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice.

2. With Christ our theme begins
The Lord of truth and love,
When He had purg’d our sins 
He took His seat above.
Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice.

3. His kingdom cannot fail,
He’ll rule o’er earth and heav’n,
The keys of death and hell 
To Him alone are giv’n.
Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice.

4. Rejoice in glorious hope:
Jesus, the Lord, shall come,
And take His brethren up 
To their eternal home.
Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
Rejoice, again we say, rejoice.
