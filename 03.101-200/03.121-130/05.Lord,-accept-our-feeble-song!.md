1. Lord, accept our feeble song!
Pow’r and praise to Thee belong;
We would all Thy grace record,
Holy, holy, holy Lord!

2. Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop, 
Thence is all Thy people’s hope;
Thou wast poor, that we might be 
Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.

3. When we think of love like this,
Joy and shame our hearts possess;
Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus, 
Shame, for such returns from us.

4. Yet we hope the day to see,
When we shall from sin be free;
When to Thee in glory brought,
We shall serve Thee as we ought.
