1. Look, ye saints,—the sight is glorious,— 
See “the Man of Sorrows” now,121
From the fight returned victorious,
Ev’ry knee to Him doth bow.
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crowns become the Victor’s brow.

2. Crown the Saviour! Angels, own H im!
Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
In the seat of pow’r enthrone Him, 
While the vault of heaven rings, 
Crown H im! Crown H im!
Crown the Saviour, “King of kings!

3. Sinners in derision crown’d Him
Mocking thus the Saviour’s claim: 
Saints and angels, crowd around Him, 
Own His title, praise His name; 
Crown H im! Crown H im!
Spread abroad the Victor’s fame,

4. H ark! those bursts of acclamation:
H ark! those loud triumphant chords! 
Jesus takes the highest station,
O what joy the sight affords!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
“King of kings, and Lord of lords!”
