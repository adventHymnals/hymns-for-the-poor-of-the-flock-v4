1. Rock of Ages! cleft for me,
Grace hath hid me safe in Thee! 
Where the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flow’d,
Are of sin the double cure;
Cleansing from its guilt and pow’r.

2. Not the labour of my hands
Could fulfil the Law’s demands; 
Could my zeal no respite know, 
Could my tears for ever flow, 
Nothing could for sin atone—
But Thy blood, and Thine alone!

3. Nothing in my hand I brought,
But to Thee for mercy sought: 
Naked, came to Thee for dress: 
Helpless, look’d to Thee for grace: 
Yet, tho’ lost, undone 1 came 
Wash’d'and justified! am!

4. While 1 draw this fleeting breath,
If my eyelids close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown, 
Still of Thee I’ll sing alone:— 
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
All my boast and jo y’s in Thee.
