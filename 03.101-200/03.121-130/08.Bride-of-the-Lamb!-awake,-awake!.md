####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Bride of the Lamb! awake, awake 1 
Why sleep for sorrow now?128
The hope of glory, Christ, is thine,
A child of glory thou.

2. Thy spirit through the lonely night,
From earthly joy apart,
Hath sigh’d for one that’s far away,
The Bridegroom of thy heart.

3. But see, the night is waning fast,
The breaking mom is near,
And Jesus comes with voice of love, 
Thy drooping heart to cheer.

4. He comes—for O His yearning heart
No more can bear delay,
To scenes of full unmingled joy 
To call His Bride away.

5. This earth, the scene of all His woe,
A homeless wild to thee,
Full soon upon His heav’nly throne 
Its rightful King shall see.

6. Thou too shalt reign—He will not wear
His crown of joy alone,
And Earth His royal Bride shall see 
Beside Him on the throne.

7. Then weep no more,’tis all thine own, 
His crown, His joy divine,
And sweeter far than all beside,
He, He Himself is thine.
