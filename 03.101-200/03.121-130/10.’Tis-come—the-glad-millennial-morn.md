I’Tis come—the glad millennial m o m! 
The Son of David reigns—
Sing, sing, O earth! for thou art free, 
And Satan is in chains—

2. Rejoice, for thou shalt feel no more
The ruthless tyrant’s rod,
Nor lose again the gracious smile 
Of thine incarnate God.

3. But chiefly thou, O Solyma!
Thou queen of cities, sing,
With shouts of triumph welcome now 
The morning-star, thy King.

4. He, gracious Saviour, faithful still
To thee, His faithless dove,
Forgives thee all, and bids thee dwell 
Within His breast of love.

5. Nor thee alone, for see, on high
His Saints triumphant now,
With all the hosts of Seraphim,
In ceaseless worship bow.

6. On Him the happy myriads there
Unwearied love to gaze,
There He amid His brethren dwells, 
The Leader of their praise.

7. Oh blessed Lord! we little dream’d
Of such a morn as th is!
Such rivers of unmingled joy,
Such full unbounded bliss.131

8. And O how sweet the happy thought I
That all we taste or see,
We owe it to the dying Lamb,
We owe it all to Thee.

9. Yes, dearest Saviour, one with Thee,
Sweet source of joy divine!
With Thee we live, with Thee we reign, 
And we are wholly Thine.
