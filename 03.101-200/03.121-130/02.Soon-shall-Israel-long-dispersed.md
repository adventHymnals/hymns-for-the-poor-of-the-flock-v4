####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Soon shall Israel, long dispersed,
Mourning, seek the Lord their God; 
Look on Him Whom once they pierced, 
Own and kiss the chast’ning rod.

2. Then all Isr’el shall be saved,
War and tum ult then shall cease; 
While the Blessed Son of David 
Rules a conquer’d world in peace.

3. Zion’s King shall reign victorious,
All the earth shall own His sway;
He will make His kingdom glorious, 
And shall reign through endless day.
