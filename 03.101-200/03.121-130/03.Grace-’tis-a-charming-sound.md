####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Grace!’Tis a charming sound,
Harmonious to the ear;
Heav’n with the echo shall resound, 
And all the earth shall hear.

2. Grace taught our wand’ring feet
To tread the heav'nly road;
And new supplies, each hour we meet, 
While walking thus with God.124

3.’Twas Grace that wrote each name
In Life’s eternal book;
’Twas Grace that gave us to the Lamb 
Whp all our sorrows took.

4. Grace sav’d us from the foe,
Grace taught us how to p ray;
And God will ne’er His grace forego,
Till we have won the day.

5. May Grace, free Grace, inspire
Our souls with strength divine;
May all our thoughts to God aspire,
And Grace in service shine.
