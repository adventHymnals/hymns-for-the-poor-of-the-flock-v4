1. The King of kings and Lord of lords 
Shall soon with clouds descend,
And the last trumpet’s awful voice 
The heav’ns and earth shall rend.

2. Then they who live shall changed be,
And they who sleep shall wake; 
The grave shall yield its prisoners,
And earth’s foundations shake.

3. The saints of God, from death set free,
With joy shall mount on high;
The Lord is come—and gladly they 
Shall meet Him in the sky.

4. Together to their Father’s house,
With joyful hearts they go;
And dwell for ever with the Lamb, 
Beyond the reach of woe.

5. A few short years of evil past,
We reach the happy shore,
Where death-divided friends at last 
Shall meet, to part no more.
