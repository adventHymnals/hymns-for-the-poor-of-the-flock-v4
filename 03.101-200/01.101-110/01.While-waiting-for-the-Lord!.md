## 101. While waiting for the Lord!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. While waiting for the Lord!
(Mid foes and darkness still)
Truth, light and grace beam from the word, 
My soul with joy to fill.

2. A Father’s gracious hand,
Whose love can never fail,
Upholds, sustains, and makes me stand, 
Whatever foes assail.

3. For Jesus, by His death
Hath rent the veil in twain,
That while I draw this fleeting breath,
I might this blessing gain.

4. Till known as I am known,
Then still this grace afford;
Till I repeat before the throne ,
“For ever with the Lord.”
