####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. How can we sink with such a prop
As the eternal God,
Who bears the earth’s huge pillars up,
And spread the heav’ns abroad.

2. How can we die while Jesus lives,
As risen from the dead?
Since life and grace the church receives,
In her exalted Head.

3. All that we are, and all we have,
Shall be for ever Thine;
And all a duteous heart would give, 
Our cheerful hands resign.

4. For if we might make some reserve, 
And duty did not call,
Thou lov’st us, Lord, with such a love, 
That we would give Thee all.
