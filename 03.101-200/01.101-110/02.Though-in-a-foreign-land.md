## 102. Though in a foreign land
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Though in a foreign land,
We are not far from hom e;
And nearer to our rest above,
We ev’ry moment come,

2. Secure within the veil,
Christ is our anchor strong;
While pow’r supreme, and love divine, 
Still guide us safe along.103

3. And should the surges rise—
Should sore afflictions come—
Blest is the sorrow, kind the storm, 
That brings us nearer home.

4. God’s grace will to the end
Clearer and brighter shine;
Nor present things, nor things to come, 
Can change His love divine.

5. Soon shall our pains and fears
For ever pass away;
For we shall soon the Saviour see 
In everlasting day.
