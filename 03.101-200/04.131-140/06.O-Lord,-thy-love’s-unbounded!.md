        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 136. O Lord, thy love’s unbounded!. O Lord, Thy love’s unbounded! So full, so vast, so free! Our thoughts are all confounded  Whene’er we think of Thee: For us Thou cams’t from Heav’n, For us to bleed and die; That purchas’d and forgiven, We might ascend on High.

1. O Lord, Thy love’s unbounded!
So full, so vast, so free!
Our thoughts are all confounded 
Whene’er we think of Thee:
For us Thou cams’t from Heav’n,
For us to bleed and die;
That purchas’d and forgiven,
We might ascend on High.

2. O let this, love constrain us
To give our hearts to Thee:
Let nothing henceforth pain us,
But that which paineth Thee.
Our joy, our one endeavour—
Thro’ sufFring, conflict, shame,—
To serve Thee, gracious Saviour,
And magnify Thy name.
