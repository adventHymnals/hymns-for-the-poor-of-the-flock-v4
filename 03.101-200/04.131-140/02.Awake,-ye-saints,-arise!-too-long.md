1. Awake, ye saints, arise! too long
In heaviness we sing,
’Tis time to raise a gladlier song,
And strike a louder string;

2. In faith we wait for that dear place
The lov’d Apostle view’d,
When full before his ravish’d gaze,
The Holy City stood.

3. L o! where the pearly gates unfold,
A kingly, priestly train,
With robes of white, and crowns of gold, 
Ascend with Christ to re ign!

4. No moon, in borrow’d glory bright,
No Sun, remotely fair;
Jehovah-Jesus is the light,
Their joy—The Lord is there l

5. God of the new Jerusalem,
From Thee this glory flows,
Be ours the grace that prosper’d them,
And ours the same repose.
