1. W e are not come to the burning brow, 
Whence the fiery streams of vengeance flow, 
To the voice of words, and the trumpet-sound, 
Where the prostrate hosts lay quaking round;

2. But we are come to the angels’ abode,
That numberless wait round the throne of God, 
Tothechurch of the first-born enroll’d on high, 
And the spirits of saints who no more may die;

3. And we are come to the sprinkled shrine, 
Where Justice and Mercy unitedly shine,
And the still, small voice of the blood that shed 
It’s blessing on the murderer’s head:

4.’Tis “Peace” to us our God thus speaks, 
Before His vengeance in thunder breaks;
He shall shake the skies, the seas and the shore, 
He shall shake them once, and shall shake no 
,jnore.
