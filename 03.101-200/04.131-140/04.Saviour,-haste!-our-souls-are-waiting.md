```txt
1. Saviour, haste! our souls are waiting
For the long expected day,
When, new heav’ns and earth creating, 
Thou shalt banish grief away,
All the sorrow,
Caus’d by sin and Satan’s sway.

2. H aste! O hasten Thine appearing!
Take Thy mourning people home: 
’Tis this hope our spirits cheering, ■ 
While we in the desert roam,
Makes Thy people
Strangers here, till Thou dost come.

3. Lord, how long shall the creation
Groan and travail sore in pain; 
Waiting for its sure salvation,
When Thou shalt in glory reign,
And like Eden,
This sad earth shall bloom again?

4. Gather, too, Thy chosen nation,
Israel’s long afflicted race;
Let them find Thy free salvation,
Own and trust Thy wondrous grace; 
And adoring,
Look on Thy once marred face.

5. Reign, O reign, Almighty Saviour! 
Heav’n and earth in one unite; 
Make it known, that in Thy favour, 
There alone is life and light: 
When we see Thee,
We shall have unmix’d delight.
