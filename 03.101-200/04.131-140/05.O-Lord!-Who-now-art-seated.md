1. O L ord! Who now art seated,
Above the Heav’ns on high,
(The gracious work completed,
For which Thou cam’st to die);
To Thee our hearts are lifted,
While pilgrims wand’ring here,
For Thou alone art gifted 
Our ev’ry weight to bear.

2. We know that Thou hast bought us,
And wash’d us in Thy blood;
We know Thy grace has brought us, 
As kings and priests to God.
We know that soon the morning, 
Long look’d-for hast’neth near, 
When we, at Thy returning,
In glory shall appear.
