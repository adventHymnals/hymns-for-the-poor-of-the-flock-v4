####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
And drives away his fear.

2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

3. Dear nam e! the rock on which I build;
My shield and hiding-place;
My never-failing treas’ry, fill’d 
With boundless stores of grace.

4. Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King;
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, 
Accept the praise I bring.

5. Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thou ght;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
I’ll praise Thee as I ought.

6. Till then I would Thy love proclaim
W ith ev’ry fleeting breath;
And triumph in that blessed name 
Which quells the power of Death.
