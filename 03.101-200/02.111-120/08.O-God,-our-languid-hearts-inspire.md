####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O God, our languid hearts inspire, 
(For here we know Thou a rt);
And freely of Thy heav’nly fire,
To every soul impart.119

2. For Jesus’ sake, we pray Thee, here
Thy presence now display;
As Thou hast giv’n a place for pray’r, 
So give us faith to pray.

3. Amongst us, Lord, let holy peace,
And love, and concord dwell;
And give each troubl’d conscience ease, 
Each wounded spirit heal.

4. May we in faith' receive Thy word,
In faith present our p rayer;
And in the bosom of our Lord 
Cast off our ev’ry care.
