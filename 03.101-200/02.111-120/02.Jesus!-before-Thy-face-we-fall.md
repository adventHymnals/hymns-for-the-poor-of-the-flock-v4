####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
Jesus! before Thy face we fall,
Our Lord, our life, our hope, our all;
For we have no where else to flee;
No Sanctuary, Lord, but Thee.

2. In Thee we ev’ry glory view,
Of safety, strength, and beauty to o;
’Tis all our rest and peace to see 
Our Sanctuary, Lord, in Thee.

3. Whatever foes or fears betide,
In Thy dear presence let us hide;
And while we rest our souls on Thee,
Do Thou our Sanctuary be.

4. Through time, with all its changing scenes, 
And all the grief that intervenes,
Let this support each fainting heart,
That Thou our Sanctuary art.
