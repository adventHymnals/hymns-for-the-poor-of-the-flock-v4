####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. N othing but Thy blood, O Jesus,
Could relieve the sinner’s sm art; 
Nothing else from guilt release us, 
Nothing else could melt the heart.

2. Sense of sin doth only harden
All the while it works alone;
But the grace that seals our pardon, 
Soon dissolves a heart of stone.
