1. Awake, each saint, in joyful lays,
To sing thy great Redeemer's praise 
He justly claims a song from thee:
His loving-kindness, O how free!

2. He saw thee ruin’d in the fall,
Yet lov’d thee, notwithstanding all;
He sav’d thee from thy low estate:
His loving-kindness, O how great!

3. Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes, 
Though earth and hell its way oppose; 
He safely leads His church along:
His loving-kindness, O how strong!

4. When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gather’d thick, and thunder”d loud; 
He with His Church has always stood: 
His loving-kindness, O how good!

5. Soon shall we mount and soar away,
To the bright realms of endless day; 
And sing with rapture and surprise,
His loving-kindness in the skies.116
