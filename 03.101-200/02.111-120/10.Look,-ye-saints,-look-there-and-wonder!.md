1. Loo k, ye saints, look there and wonder!
See the place where Jesus lay:
He has burst the bands asunder;
He has borne our sins away.
Joyful tidings!
Yes, the Lord is ris’n, we say.

2. Jesus triumph’d! Sing ye praises;
By His death He overcame:
Thus the Lord His glory raises;
Thus He fills His foes with shame.
Sing ye praises!
Praises to the Victor’s name.
