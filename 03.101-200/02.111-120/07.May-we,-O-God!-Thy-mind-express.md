1. May we, O God! Thy mind express, 
Stand forth Thy chosen witnesses;
Thy pow’r unto salvation shew,
In love and holiness below.

2. The fulness of Thy grace-receive,
And simply to Thy glory live;
Strongly reflect the light divine,
And in a world of darkness shine.

3. In us let all mankind behold
How Christians liv’d in days of old; 
Mighty their envious foes to move,
A prbverb of reproach—and love.

4. O make us of one soul and heart,
The all-conforming mind impart,
And grant us peace and unity 1
As taught, renew’d, and rul’d by Thee.
