1. O Jesus, to tell of Thy love
Our souls shall for ever delight,
And join with the blessed above 
In praises by day and by night. 
Wherever we follow Thee, Lord, 
Admiring, adoring, we see 
That love which was stronger than death, 
Flow out without limit, and free.

2. Descending from glory on high,
With men Thy delight was to dwell, 
Contented, our surety to die,
By dying to save us from hell; 
Enduring the grief and the shame,
And bearing our sin on the cross,
Oh 1 who would not boast of this love, 
And count the worldâ€™s glory but loss?
