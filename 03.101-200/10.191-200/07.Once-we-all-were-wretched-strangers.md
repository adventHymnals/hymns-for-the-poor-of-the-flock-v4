1. Once we all were wretched strangers,
All the enemies of G od;
Heedless of our sins and dangers,
On the brink of death we stood, 
Nought deserving 
But of wrath the fiery flood.

2. Now our blinded eyes are waking,
And our misery we se e;
Now our stony hearts are breaking; 
From eternal wrath we flee 
• To the refuge,
Open’d, Lamb of God, in Thee.

3.’Twas Thy Love, O God, that knew us
Earth’s foundation long before:
That same love to Jesus drew us 
By its sweet constraining pow’r, 
And will keep us 
Safely now, and evermore.

4. God of love, our souls adore Thee!
We would still Thy grace proclaim, 
Till we cast our crowns before Thee, 
And in glory praise Thy nam e; 
Hallelujah!
Be to God and to the Lamb.
