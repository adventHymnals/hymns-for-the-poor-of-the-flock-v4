####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Happy Christian, God’s own child, 
Chosen, call’d, and reconcil’d;
Once a rebel full of taint,
Now a duteous, humble saint.

2. Happy Christian, look on high,
See thy portion in the sk y;
Fix’d by everlasting love,
Who that portion can remove?

3. Happy Christian, though the earth 
Cannot know thy gracious worth,
Yet thy God shall soon proclaim, 
Through all heav’n, thy favour’d name.

4. Happy Christian, angels say,
“Turn thy heart from earth away,
Leave the world and all its woes,
Take with Christ thy sweet repose.”

5. Happy Christian, onward fly,
Rise, the kingdom now is nigh!
When thou shalt, upon His throne,
See what Christ has made thine own.
