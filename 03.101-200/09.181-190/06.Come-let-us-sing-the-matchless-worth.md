1. Come let us sing the matchless worth, 
And sweetly sound the glories forth
Which in the Saviour shine,
To God and Christ our praises bring: 
The song with which the heavens ring,
Now let us gladly join.

2. How rich the precious blood He spilt, 
Our ransom from the dreadful guilt
Of sin against our God;
How perfect was His righteousness,
In which unspotted beauteous dress,
His saints have ever stood!

3. How rich the character He bears,
And all the form of love He wears,
Exalted on the throne;187
In songs of sweet untiring praise,
We would, to everlasting days,
Make all His glories known.

4. And soon the happy day shall come, 
When we shall reach our destin’d home, 
And see Him face to face;
Then with our Saviour, Brother, Friend, 
The one unbroken day we’ll spend 
In singing still His grace.
