1. F rom Egypt lately come,
Where death and darkness reign,
We seek our new, our better home, 
Where we our rest shall gain: 
Hallelujah!
We are on our way to God.

2. To Canaan’s sacred bound
We haste with songs of joy,
Where peace and liberty are found, 
And sweets that never cloy; 
Hallelujah! &c.

3. There sin and sorrow cease,
And ev’ry conflict’s o’er;
There we shall dwell in endless peace, 
And never hunger more.
Hallelujah! &c.

4. There in celestial strains,
Enraptur’d myriads sing,
There love in every bosom reigns,
For God Himself is king;
Hallelujah, &c.

5. We soon shall join the throng;
Their pleasures we shall share,
And sing the everlasting song,
With all the ransom’d the re;
Hallelujah, &c.

6. How sweet the prospect is!
It cheers the pilgrim’s breast;
We’re journeying through the wilderness, 
But soon shall gain our rest;
Hallelujah 1 &c.
