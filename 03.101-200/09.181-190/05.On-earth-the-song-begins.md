####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. On earth the song begins;
In heav’n more sweet and loud,
“To Him that cleans’d our sins 
By His atoning blood 
“To Him,” we sing in joyful strain,
“Be honour, pow’r, and praise, Amen.”

2. Believers now repeat,
What heav’n with gladness owns; 
And while before His feet 
The elders cast their crowns,
Come, imitate the choirs above,
And sing aloud the Saviour s love.

3. Alone He bore the cross,
Alone its grief sustain’d;
His was the shame and loss,
And He the vict’ry gain’d;
The mighty work was all His own,
Tho’ we shall share His glorious throne.
