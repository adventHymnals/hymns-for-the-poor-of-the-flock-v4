[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wFG96pzt7KdZucmluoXoc6HABVjDBqp/edit?mode=html)



    1. Soldiers of Christ, arise,
    And put your armour on—
    Strong in the strength which God supplies 
    Through His eternal Son.

    2. Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
    And in His mighty pow’r—
    Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
    Is more than conqueror.

    3. Stand in His heav’nly might,
    With all His strength endu’d,
    But take, to arm you for the fight,
    The panoply of God.

    4. That having all things done,
    And all your conflicts past,
    Ye may o’ercome, through Christ alone, 
    And stand complete at last.
