    1. With hope deferr’d, oft faint and sick,
    “Why tarries Christ?” we cry;
    And if He should rebuke our haste, 
    Thus would we make reply;—

    2. “May not the exile, Lord, desire
    Her own sweet realm to see?
    May not the captive seek release?
    The pris’ner to be free?

    3. “Children, when far away, may long
    For home and kindred dear,
    And she that loves her absent Lord, 
    Must grieve till He appear.”
