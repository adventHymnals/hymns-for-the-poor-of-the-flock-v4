[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13liL0MCx4rvdlyNWwA1G5TZPwSgfhCp7/edit?mode=html)



    1. O blessed Saviour, is Thy love
    So great! so full! so free!
    Behold! we give our thoughts, our hearts, 
    Our lives, our all to Thee.

    2. We love Thee for the glorious worth
    Which in Thyself we see:
    We love Thee for that shameful cross, 
    Endur’d so patiently.

    3. No man of greater love can boast
    Than for his friend to die;
    Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!
    What love with Thine can vie?

    4. Though in the very form of God,
    With heav’nly glory crown’d,
    Thou didst partake of human flesh,
    Beset with sorrow round.

    5. Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
    In ev’ry thing but sin;
    That we as like Thee might become,
    As we unlike had been.

    6. Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,
    In ev’ry beauteous grace;
    From glory into glory chang’d,
    ’Till we behold Thy face.

    7. O Lord! we treasure in our souls
    The mem’ry of Thy love;
    And ever shall Thy name to us 
    A grateful odour prove.
