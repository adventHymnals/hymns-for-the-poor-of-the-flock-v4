    1. Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness 
    Our beauty are, our glorious dress; 
    Midst flaming worlds, in these array’d 
    With joy shall we lift up the head.

    2. Bold shall we stand in that great day, 
    For who aught to our charge shall lay, 
    While by Thy blood absolv’d we are 
    From sin’s tremendous curse and fear?

    3. Thus Abraham, the friend of God,
    Thus all the saints redeem’d with blood,
    Saviour of sinners Thee proclaim 
    And all their boast is in Thy name.

    4. This spotless robe the same appears, 
    When ruin’d nature sinks in years,
    No age can change its glorious hue,
    The robe of Christ is ever new.

    5. Then let the dead now hear Thy voice, 
    And bid Thy chosen ones rejoice,
    Their beauty this, their glorious dress, 
    Jesus, the Lord our righteousness.
