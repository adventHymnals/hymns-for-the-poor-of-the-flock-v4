    1. Children of the heav’nly King,
    As ye journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing the Saviour’s worthy praise, 
    Glorious in His works and ways.

    2. Ye are traveling home to God 
    In the way the fathers trod;
    Soon, the dead in Christ, and ye 
    "With the Lord shall ever be.”

    3. Shout, ye ransom’d flock and blest, 
    Ye on Jesus’ throne shall rest; 
    There your seat is now prepar’d, 
    There your kingdom and reward.

    4. Fear not, though a feeble band, 
    Mid the conflict boldly stand:
    Jesus Christ, God’s own dear Son, 
    Bids you undismay’d go on.

    5. Lord, submissively we go,
    Gladly leaving all below;
    Only Thou our Leader be,
    And we still will follow Thee.
