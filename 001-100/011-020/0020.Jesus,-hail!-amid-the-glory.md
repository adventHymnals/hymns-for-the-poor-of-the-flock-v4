    1. Jesus, hail! amid the glory,
    Where for us Thou dost abide;
    (All the heav’nly hosts adore Thee!) 
    Standing at Thy Father’s side,
    There for us Thou now art pleading;
    While Thou dost our place prepare, 
    For the church still interceding,
    Till in glory it appear.

    2. Worship, honour, power, and blessing, 
    Thou shalt then from all receive; 
    Loudest praises, without ceasing,
    All that earth or heav’n can give: 
    ’Till that day,—th’ angelic spirits, 
    With the church, in feebler lays, 
    Still shall try to sing Thy merits,
    And to chant Thy Father’s praise.
