    1. Brethren, let us join to bless 
    Jesus Christ, our joy and peace!
    Let our praise to Him be giv’n,
    High at God’s right hand in heav’n.

    2. Master, lo! to Thee we bow,
    Thou art Lord, and only Thou:
    Thou the virgin’s blessed seed,
    Thou the Church’s glorious Head.

    3. Thee the angels ceaseless sing,
    Thee we praise, The Priest and King; 
    Worthy is Thy name of praise,
    Full of glory, full of Grace!

    4. Joyful tidings Thou hast brought,
    Of salvation, by Thee wrought: 
    Wrought for all Thy church! and we 
    Worship in their company.

    5. We, Thy little flock, adore 
    Thee, the Lord, for evermore!
    Ever resting in Thy love,
    ’Till we join with those above.
