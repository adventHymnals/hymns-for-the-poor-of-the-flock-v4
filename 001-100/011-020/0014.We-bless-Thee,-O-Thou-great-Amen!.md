    1. We bless Thee, O Thou great Amen! 
    Jehovah’s pledge to sinful men,
    Confirming all His word!
    Doubtful no promises remain,
    For all are Yea, and all Amen,
    In Thee, our faithful Lord.

    2. How great the grace of God to bless 
    By Thee, the Lord our righteousness!
    By Thee, we say again:
    For to us all things thus are sure,
    Through life, in death, and evermore,
    By Thee, the Great Amen.

    3. O faithful Witness of our God,
    Who cain’st by water and by blood!
    In Thee (the Holy One)
    God’s record doth for ever stand,
    Of life eternal, from His hand,
    To all in Thee the Son.

    4. Gladly His promises we hear,
    For God’s “Amen” dispels all fear,
    His faithfulness it proves;
    And while such grace from God is shown, 
    To His Amen, we add our own:
    For our Amen He loves.
