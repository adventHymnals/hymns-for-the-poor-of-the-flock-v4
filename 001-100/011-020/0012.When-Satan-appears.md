    1. When Satan appears
    To stop up our path,
    And fill us with fears,
    We triumph by faith;
    He cannot take from us, 
    Though oft he has tried,
    This heart-cheering promise,— 
    The Lord will provide.

    2. He tells us we’re weak,
    Our hope is in vain,
    The good that we seek 
    We ne’er shall obtain;
    But when such suggestions 
    Our spirits have tried,
    This answers all questions,— 
    The Lord will provide.

    3. No strength of our own
    Or goodness we claim;
    Yet since we have known 
    The Savior’s great name,
    In this our strong tower 
    For safety we hide,
    The Lord is our power,
    The Lord will provide.

    4. Should life sink apace,
    And death be in view,
    This word of His grace 
    Shall comfort us through:
    No fearing or doubting,—
    With Christ on their side 
    Who cannot die shouting, 
    The Lord will provide?
