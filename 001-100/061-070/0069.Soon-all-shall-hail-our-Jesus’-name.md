    1. Soon all shall hail our Jesus’ name,
    Angels shall prostrate fall,
    For Him the brightest glory claim,
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    2. The risen saints shall sound the lyre,
    And, as they sound it, fall 
    Before His face Who formed their choir, 
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    3. The remnant sav’d from Israel’s race,
    Redeem’d from Israel’s fall,
    Shall praise Him for His wondrous grace, 
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    4. Gentiles shall come—and every king
    Throughout this earthly ball,
    To Zion come—and tribute bring,
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    5. In Heaven—on earth—shall happy throngs
    In wond’ring rapture fall,
    And join in everlasting songs,
    To hail Him Lord of all.
