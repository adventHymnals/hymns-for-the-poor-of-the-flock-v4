    1. O Holy Saviour! Friend unseen,
    Since on Thine arm Thou bid’st us lean, 
    Help us, throughout life’s changing scene,
    By faith to cling to Thee!

    2. Blest with this fellowship divine,
    Take what Thou wilt, we’ll not repine; 
    For as the branches to the vine,
    We only cling to Thee!

    3. Tho’ far from home, fatigu’d, opprest,
    Here we have found a place of rest;
    As exiles still, yet not unblest,
    Because we cling to Thee.

    4. Without a murmur we dismiss 
    Our former dreams of earthly bliss,
    Our joy, our consolation, this,
    Each hour to cling to Thee.

    5. What, though the world deceitful prove, 
    And earthly friends and hopes remove; 
    With patient uncomplaining love,
    Still can we cling to Thee.

    6. Tho’ oft we seem to tread alone
    Life’s dreary waste, with thorns o’ergrown, 
    Thy voice .of Love, in gentlest tone, 
    Whispers, “Still cling to Me.”

    7. Though faith and hope are often tried,
    We ask not, need not, aught beside;
    So safe, so calm, so satisfied,
    The souls that cling to Thee.

    8. They fear not Satan nor the Grave,
    They know Thee near and strong to save, 
    With Thee all danger they can brave,
    Because they cling to Thee.

    9. Blest is our lot whate’er befall,
    Who can affright or who appal—
    Since on Thy strength, our rock, our all, 
    Jesus! we cling to Thee.
