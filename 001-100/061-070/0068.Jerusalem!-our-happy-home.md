## 68.  'Jerusalem! our happy home'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Z3AIgTK8u98mTlWmf2LSSRF3JVB2ju4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jerusalem! our happy home,
    Our souls still sigh for thee,
    Till all our conflicts here are past,
    And we Thy glory see.

    2. Why should we shrink at pain or woe,
    Or feel at death dismay?
    Thy matchless glory is in view 
    And realms of endless day.

    3. Apostles, martyrs, saints, shall meet
    In Thee (a ransom’d band);
    And all who follow Jesus here,
    Around Him there shall stand.

    4. Then shall His servants serve the Lord,
    From sin and sorrow free;
    Blest home! thro’ rude and stormy scenes 
    Onward we press to thee.
