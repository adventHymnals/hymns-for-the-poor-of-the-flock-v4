    1. The Church in her militant state
    Is weary, and cannot forbear;
    The saints, with desire still wait,
    To see Him again in the air!

    2. The Spirit invites in the bride,
    Her Heav’nly Lord to descend; 
    And place her, enthron’d at His side, 
    In glory that never shall end.

    3. The news of His coming I hear,
    And gladly I join in the cry,
    O Jesus in triumph appear,
    Appear on the clouds of the sky!

    4. Come Lord to the Bride of Thy love,
    In fulness of majesty come;
    And give me the mansion above, 
    Prepar’d in Thy heavenly home!
