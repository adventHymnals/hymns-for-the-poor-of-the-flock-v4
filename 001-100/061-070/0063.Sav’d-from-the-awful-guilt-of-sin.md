[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZXU_2mLq5mxl-kYyoKfhtStoXYOCkio/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sav’d from the awful guilt of sin,
    By Him Who bare the cross; 
    We’ll now a cheerful strain begin, 
    Where God began with us.

    2. We sing the vast unmeasur’d grace,
    Of height and depth untold! 
    Which did the saints elect embrace 
    As sheep within the fold.

    3. We had not known the blood for sin,
    Nor sweets of pard’ning love,
    Unless our worthless names had been 
    Enroll’d for life, above.

    4. This purpose of eternal love
    Did Jesus’ soul sustain;
    And earth or hell, the same to move,
    Did all conspire in vain.

    5. Well may we sing, since bought with blood
    Of the Begotten Son;
    O how secure God’s purpose stood 
    Ere time its race begun!
