    1. Jerusalem! our heav’nly home
    (Name to us ever dear),
    When will the Saviour come, and thou 
    To us, His Saints, appear?

    2. When shall these eyes thy jasper walls
    And gates of pearl survey;
    Thy fabric rear’d on precious stones, 
    Of ev’ry brilliant ray.

    3. Transparent as the crystal glass,
    And form’d of purest gold; 
    Perfection’s height art thou, of all 
    That man can e’er behold.

    4. In thee, the myriads of the saints
    Shall in one song unite,
    And each the bliss of all shall see 
    With infinite delight.

    5. O when, thou city of our God,
    Shalt thou for us descend;
    And our eternal sabbath come 
    When praise shall never end?
