    1. Jesus, the Lord, is ris’n
    Triumphant o’er the grave;
    For us He burst the pris’n,
    Almighty now to save:
    Captivity is captive led,
    Since Jesus liveth that was dead.

    2. Who to our charge shall lay
    Iniquity or guilt?
    All sin is done away,
    Since Jesus’ blood was spilt.
    Captivity, &c. 

    3. Who now accuseth them
    Whom God hath justified?
    Or who shall those condemn,
    For whom the Surety died?
    Captivity, &c.

    4. Christ hath the ransom paid,
    The glorious work is done;
    On Him our help is laid,
    The victory is won.
    Captivity, &c.
