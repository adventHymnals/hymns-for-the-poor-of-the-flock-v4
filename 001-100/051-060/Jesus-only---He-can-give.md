[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WPBR%2DWGSobvRSE1cIpE3%2D8U5IK8tYMc/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus only—He can give 
    Peace and comfort while we live; 
    Jesus only can supply 
    Boldness if we’re call’d to die; 
    Jesus shall our treasure be, 
    Through His own eternity:
    He is now our nearest Friend,
    And His love will never end!
