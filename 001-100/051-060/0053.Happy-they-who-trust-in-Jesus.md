    1. Happy they who trust in Jesus;
    Sweet their portion is, and sure, 
    When the foe on others seizes,
    God will keep His own secure.
    Happy people;
    Happy, though despis’d and poor.

    2. Since His love and mercy found us,
    We are precious in His sight;
    Thousands now may fall around us, 
    Thousands more be put to flight,
    But His presence 
    Keeps us safe by day and night.

    3. Lo! our Saviour never slumbers,
    Ever watchful is His care;
    Though we cannot boast of numbers,
    In His strength secure we are.
    Sweet their portion,
    Who our Saviour’s kindness share.

    4. As the bird beneath her feathers,
    Guards the objects of her care,
    So the Lord His children gathers,
    Spreads His wings and hides them there: 
    Thus protected,
    All their foes they boldly dare.
