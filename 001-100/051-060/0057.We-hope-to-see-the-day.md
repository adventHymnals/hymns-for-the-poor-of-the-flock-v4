    1. We hope to see the day
    When toil and strife shall cease; 
    When we shall cast our arms away,
    And dwell in endless peace.

    2. This hope supports us here,
    It makes our burdens light;
    It serves our drooping hearts to cheer 
    Till faith shall end in sight.

    3. Till of the prize possessâ€™d,
    We hear of war no more,
    And, O sweet thought! for ever rest, 
    On yonder peaceful shore.
