    1. Hark! ten thousand voices crying,
    “Lamb of God!” with one accord; 
    Thousand thousand saints replying, 
    Wake at once th’ echoing chord.

    2. “Praise the Lamb,” the chorus waking,
    All in heav’n together throng;
    Loud and far each tongue partaking ,
    Rolls around the endless song.

    3. Grateful incense this, ascending
    Ever to the Father’s Throne;
    Ev’ry knee to Jesus bending,
    All the mind in heav’n is one.

    4. All the Father’s counsels claiming
    Equal honours to the Son,
    All the Son’s effulgence beaming,
    Makes the Father’s glory known.

    5. By the Spirit all pervading,
    Hosts unnumber’d round the Lamb, 
    Crown’d with light and joy unfading, 
    Hail Him as the great “I am.”

    6. Joyful now the new creation
    Rests in undisturb’d repose,
    Blest in Jesu’s full salvation,
    Sorrow now, nor thraldom knows.

    7. Hark! the heavenly notes again!
    Loudly swells the song of praise; 
    Throughout creation’s vault, Amen! 
    Amen! responsive joy doth raise.
