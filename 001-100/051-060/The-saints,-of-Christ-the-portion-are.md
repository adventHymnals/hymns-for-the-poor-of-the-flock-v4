    1. The saints, of Christ the portion are,
    Redeem’d by grace, reclaim’d by pow’r; 
    His special choice and tender care,
    Own them, and guard them every hour.

    2. He guards them in a barren land,
    Beset with sins, and fears, and woes;
    He leads and guides them by His hand, 
    And keeps them safe from all their foes.
