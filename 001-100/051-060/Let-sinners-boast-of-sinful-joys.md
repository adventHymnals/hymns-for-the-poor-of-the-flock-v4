    1. Let sinners boast of sinful joys,
    The poor delights of sense;
    ’Tis Christ our inmost thoughts employs, 
    We draw our comforts thence.

    2. With sweet contentment now we bid,
    Farewell to pleasures here;
    With Christ in God our life is hid,
    And all its springs are there.

    3.’Tis now conceal’d and lodg’d secure,
    In God’s eternal Son;
    From age to age it shall endure, 
    Though to the world unknown.

    4. Then Lord, remove whate’er divides,
    Our lingering souls from Thee; 
    'Tis fit that where the Head resides,
    The members too should be.
