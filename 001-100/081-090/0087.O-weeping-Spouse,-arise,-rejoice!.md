    1. O weeping Spouse, arise! rejoice!
    Put off thy weeds of mourning,
    And hail the Bridegroom’s welcome voice, 
    In triumph now returning.

    2. He comes! the Bridegroom promis’d long;
    Go forth with joy to meet Him;
    And raise the new and nuptial song,
    In cheerful strains to greet Him.

    3. Adorn thyself, the feast prepare
    With hallelujahs swelling;
    He comes, with thee all joys to share,
    And make this earth His dwelling. ~This~ ~takes~ ~place~ ~after~ ~the~ ~millenium~
