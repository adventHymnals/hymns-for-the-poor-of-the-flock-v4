[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARG7zI6UhKuHfo2y7kXSb5tGhZfpoCGQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Why should I fear the darkest hour,
    Or tremble at the tempter’s pow’r?
    Jesus vouchsafes to be my tow’r.

    2. Though hot the fight, why quit the field? 
    Why should I either flee or yield,
    Since Jesus is my mighty shield?

    3. I know not what may soon betide,
    Or how my wants shall be supplied;
    But Jesus knows, and will provide.

    4. Though sin would fill me with distress,
    The throne of grace I can address,
    For Jesus is my righteousness.

    5. Though faint my prayers, and cold my love. 
    My stedfast hope shall not remove 
    While Jesus intercedes above.

    6. Against me earth and hell combine;
    But on my side is pow’r divine:
    Jesus is all, and He is mine.
