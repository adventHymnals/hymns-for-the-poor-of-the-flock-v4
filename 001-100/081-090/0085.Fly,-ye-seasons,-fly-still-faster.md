    1. Fly, ye seasons, fly still faster,
    Let the glorious day come on,
    When we shall behold our Master 
    Seated on His heav’nly throne;
    When the Saviour 
    Shall descend to claim His own.

    2. What is earth, with all its treasures,
    To the joy the Gospel brings?
    Well may we resign its pleasures, 
    Jesus brings us better things;
    All His people
    Draw from heav’n’s eternal springs.

    3. Fly, ye seasons, fly still faster,
    Swiftly bring the glorious day; 
    Jesus, come, our Lord and Master, 
    Come from heav’n without delay, 
    Take Thy people,
    Take, O take them hence away.
