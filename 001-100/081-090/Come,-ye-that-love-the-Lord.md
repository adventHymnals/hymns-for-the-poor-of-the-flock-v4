    1. Come, ye that love the Lord,
    And let your joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus approach the throne.

    2. Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God;
    But children should their praises bring, 
    And speak their joys abroad.

    3. The God who rules on high,
    And all the earth surveys;
    Who rides upon the stormy sky,
    And calms the roaring seas;

    4. This glorious God is ours—
    A God of boundless love!
    And soon He’ll send His heav’nly pow’rs 
    To carry us above.

    5. There we shall see His face,
    And never, never sin;
    There from the fountain of His grace 
    Drink endless pleasures in.

    6. And now, until we rise
    To that immortal state,
    The thoughts of such amazing bliss
    Should constant joy create.
