    1. To see the Saviour as He is,
    What can we look for more than this? 
    Of heav’n ’tis all His people know,
    No more is needful here below.

    2. A paradise let others feign,
    Where all their fav’rite good obtain, 
    Where, free from all restraint and fear, 
    They feast on joys but tasted here.

    3. We ask no other heav’n than this,
    To see the Saviour as He is,
    To take our place upon His throne,
    And know, as we ourselves are known.

    4. Where Jesus is, ’tis heav’n to be,
    'Tis heav’n the Saviour’s face to see; 
    We know, tho’ all the world revile, 
    Celestial joy is in His smile.

    5. The little that on earth we know, 
    Makes us impatient hence to go,
    To rise from earth to heav’n above, 
    And see the object of our love.
