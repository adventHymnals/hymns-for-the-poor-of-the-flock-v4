    1. Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah!
    Pilgrims through this barren land;
    We are weak, but Thou art mighty;
    Hold us by Thy pow’rful hand.
    Bread of heaven!
    Feed us now and evermore.

    2. Open stand, Thou living Fountain!
    Whence the healing waters flow;
    Be our fiery, cloudy Pillar 
    All the dreary desert through.
    Strong Deliv’rer!
    Be Thou still our Strength and Shield.

    3. While we tread this vale of sorrow,
    May we in Thy love abide.
    Keep us, O most gracious Saviour! 
    Cleaving closely to Thy side,
    Still relying
    On The Father’s changeless love.

    4. Saviour, come, we long to see Thee, 
    Long to dwell with Thee above, 
    And to know in full communion 
    All the sweetness of Thy love.
    Come, Lord Jesus,
    Take Thy waiting people home.
