[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15baL3xkz2pJPDqtGVzbGkTSlD0cZpfuz/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though twice ten thousand sinners go
    Down to the pit of endless woe, 
    God’s choice, from all repentance free, 
    The guard of His elect shall be.

    2. To fall from that, if God be true,
    No sinner shall whom He foreknew; 
    Whom God will save, to God must rise, 
    And fill a mansion in the skies.

    3. Triumphant grace shall ever keep,
    The weakest of the way-worn sheep, 
    Salvation’s free and shall be giv’n 
    To all who trust the God of Heaven.
