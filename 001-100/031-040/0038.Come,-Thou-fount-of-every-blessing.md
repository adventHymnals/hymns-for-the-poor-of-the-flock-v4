    1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
    Tune my heart to sing Thy grace: 
    Streams of mercy never ceasing 
    Call for ceaseless songs of praise.

    2. Teach me, Lord, the rapt’rous measures
    Sung by heav’nly hosts above;
    While I sing the countless treasures 
    Of my God’s unchanging love.

    3. Jesus sought me when a stranger,
    Wand’ring from the fold of God;
    He to rescue me from danger, 
    Interpos’d His precious blood.

    4. O to grace how great a debtor
    Daily I’ m constrain’d to be!
    Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
    Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

    5. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
    Prone to leave the God I love:
    Yet Thou, Lord, hast deign’d to seal it, 
    With Thy Spirit from above;

    6. Rescued thus from sin and danger,
    Purchas’d by the Saviour’s blood, 
    May I walk on earth a stranger,
    As a Son and Heir of God.
