    1. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,*
    Of mercies past, of joys to come;
    The Lord their Saviour is, and King,
    The cross their stay, and heav’n their home.

    2. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,*
    Salvation’s theirs, and of the Lord;
    They draw from heav’n’s eternal spring,
    The living God, their great reward.

    3. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing;*
    Sweet is the subject of their song,
    Who, made the children of a King,
    Expect to sing in heav’n ere long.

    4. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,
    Whom grace has kept in dangers past; 
    And, O sweet thought! the Lord will bring 
    His people safe to heav’n at last.

    5. *Let sinners sav'd give thanks and sing,
    Of Jesus sing, through all their days;
    In heav’n their golden harps they’ll string, 
    And there for ever sing His praise.
