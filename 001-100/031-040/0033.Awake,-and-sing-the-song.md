    1. Awake, and sing the song 
    Of Moses and the Lamb:
    Wake ev’ry heart, and ev’ry tongue,
    To praise the Saviour’s name.

    2. Sing of His dying love;
    Sing of His rising pow’r;
    Sing how He intercedes above,
    For those whose sins He bore.

    3. Sing on your heav’nly road,
    Ye sons of Glory, sing;
    To God and to the Lamb of God 
    Your cheerful praises bring.

    4. Soon shall we hear Him say,
    “Come, blessed brethren, come 
    Soon will He call us hence away, 
    And take us to His home.

    5. Then shall each raptur’d tongue
    His fullest praise proclaim,
    And sweeter voices tune the song 
    Of Moses and the Lamb.
