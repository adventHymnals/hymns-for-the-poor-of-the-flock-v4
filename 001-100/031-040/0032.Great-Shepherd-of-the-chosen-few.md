    1. Great Shepherd of the chosen few,
    Thy former mercies here renew:
    And to our waiting hearts proclaim 
    The sweetness of Thy saving name.

    2. Now may we prove the power of prayer, 
    To strengthen faith and banish care;
    To teach our faint desire to rise,
    And bring all heavâ€™n before our eyes.
