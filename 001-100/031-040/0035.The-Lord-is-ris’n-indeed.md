    1. ~~The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    Then Justice asks no more;
    Mercy and Truth are now agreed, 
    Who stood oppos’d before.~~^Ps^ ^85:10^ ^-^ ^Justice^ ^and^ ^mercy^ ^have^ ^never^ ^been^ ^at^ ^variance^

    2. The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    Then all His work’s perform’d;
    The captive Surety now is freed,
    And Death, our foe, disarm’d.

    3. The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    He lives—to die no more;
    He lives—His people’s cause to plead, 
    Whose curse and shame He bore.

    4. The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    And Hell has lost its prey;
    And with Him all the ransom’d seed, 
    Shall reign in endless day.
