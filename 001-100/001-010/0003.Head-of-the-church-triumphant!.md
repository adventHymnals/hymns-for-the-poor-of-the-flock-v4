    1. Head of the church triumphant!
    We joyfully adore Thee,
    ’Till Thou appear 
    Thy members here
    Would sing like those in glory! 
    We lift our hearts and voices,
    In blest anticipation,
    And cry aloud,
    And give to God 
    The praise of our salvation.

    2. While in affliction’s furnace,
    And passing through the fire;
    The love we praise 
    Which tries our ways,
    And ever brings us nigher;
    We clap our hands, exulting,
    In Thine almighty favour,
    The love divine 
    Which made us Thine,
    Shall keep us Thine forever.

    3. Thou dost conduct Thy people, 
    Through torrents of temptation;
    Nor will we fear,
    While Thou art near 
    The fire of tribulation:
    The World, with Sin and Satan, 
    In vain our march opposes;
    By Thee we shall 
    Break through them all,
    And sing the song of Moses.

    4. By faith we see the glory 
    Of which Thou dost assure us,
    The world despise 
    For that high prize 
    Which Thou hast set before us; 
    And if Thou count us worthy,
    We each would die like Stephen, 
    And see Thee stand 
    At God’s right hand,
    To take us up to heaven.
