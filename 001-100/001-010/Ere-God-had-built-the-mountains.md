    1. Ere God had built the mountains, 
    Or rais’d the fruitful hills,
    Before He fill’d the fountains,
    That feed the running rills;
    In Thee, from everlasting,
    The wonderful I AM 
    Found pleasures never wasting, 
    And Wisdom is Thy name.

    2. When like a tent to dwell in,
    He spread the skies abroad,
    And swath’d about the swelling 
    Of ocean’s mighty flood:
    He wrought by weight and measure;
    And Thou wast with Him then: 
    Thyself the Father’s pleasure,
    And Thine, the sons of men.

    3. Thus Wisdom’s works discover
    Thy glory and Thy grace,
    Thou everlasting Lover 
    Of our unworthy race!
    Thy gracious eye survey’d us 
    Ere stars were seen above;
    In wisdom Thou hast made us,
    And died for us in love.
