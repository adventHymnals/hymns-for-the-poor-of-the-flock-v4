    1. Glory to God on High!
    Let Heav’n and Earth reply,
    *“Praise ye His name"*
    All Heaven’s hosts adore 
    Him Who our sorrows bore, 
    Crying for evermore,
    *“Worthy the Lamb”*

    2. They who surround the throne 
    Blissfully join in one,
    *Praising His name.*
    We too, who know His blood 
    Hath sealed our peace with God, 
    Will sound His fame abroad,
    *“Worthy the Lamb"*

    3. Join, all the ransom’d race,
    Our Lord and God to bless,
    *“Praise ye His name!”*
    Tell what His arm hath done! 
    What spoils from death He won! 
    Sing His great name alone!
    *“Worthy the Lamb!”*

    4. Jesus, our Lord and God,
    Bore sin’s tremendous load,
    *“Praise ye His name!”* 
    In Him will we rejoice,
    Making a cheerful noise,
    And shout with heart and voice,
    “Worthy the Lamb!”*

    5. And if we change our place,
    Yet shall we never cease 
    *Praising His name;*
    But still the offering 
    Of praise to Him shall bring,
    And without ceasing sing 
    *“Worthy the Lamb!”*
