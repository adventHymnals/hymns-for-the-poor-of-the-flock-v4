    1. “Abba,” Father,—Lord! we call Thee, 
    (Hallow’d name!) from day to day;— 
    ’Tis Thy children’s right to know Thee, 
    None but children, “Abba,” say.
    This high glory we inherit,
    Thy free gift, through Jesus’ blood; 
    ~~God the Spirit~~ Holy Spirit, with our spirit, 
    Witnesseth we’re Sons of God.

    2. Abba’s purpose gave us being,
    When in Christ, in that vast plan. 
    Abba chose the church in Jesus,
    Long before the world began;
    O what love the Father bore us!
    O how precious in His sight!— 
    When He gave His church to Jesus! 
    Jesus, His whole soul’s delight!

    3. Though our nature’s fall in Adam,
    Seem’d to shut us out from God, 
    Thus it was His counsel brought us 
    Nearer still, thro’ Jesus’ blood;
    For in Him we found redemption, 
    Grace and Glory in the Son,
    O the height and depth of Mercy!
    “Christ and the elect are one.”
