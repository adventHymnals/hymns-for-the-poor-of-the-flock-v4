    1. Richest stores of Heav’nly blessings 
    God has giv’n in Christ, His Son— 
    With the Holy Spirit’s power,
    Safe to lead His children on. 
    “Abba,” Father, makes all certain, 
    E’en by word, and oath, and blood;- 
    Abba saith, “They are My children,” 
    And they say, "Our Abba’s GOD.”

    2. Hence, through all the changing seasons, 
    Trouble, sorrow, sickness, woe, 
    Nothing changeth God’s affection,
    Abba’s love shall bring us through. 
    Soon shall all the blood-bought children, 
    Round the throne their anthems raise; 
    And, in songs of rich salvation,
    Shout to Abba endless praise.

    CHORUS.
    “Abba,” Father! Lord, we’ll call Thee, 
    Abba’ll sound through all the host;
    All in heav’n and earth adoring,
    Father, Son, ~~and~~by Holy Ghost!^and^ ^not^ ^inscripture.^ ^by^ ^-^ ^1^ ^Cor^ ^12:3,^ ^etc^
