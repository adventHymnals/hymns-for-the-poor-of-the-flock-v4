    1. Much in sorrow, oft in woe,
    Onward, Christians, onward go;
    Fight the fight! tho’ worn with strife,
    Battle on to life.
    Onward, Christians! onward go;
    Join the war, and face the foe;
    Faint not, little doth remain 
    Of the drear campaign.

    2. Shrink not, Christians: will you yield? 
    Will you quit the battle field?
    Shrink not, ere the fight be done.
    Ere the prize be won,
    Mail’d in armour, heav’nly bright, 
    Strong in Him, Whose grace is might, 
    Onward, Christians, onward go, 
    Conquer ev’ry foe.

    3. Fight the glorious fight of faith,
    Fear not conflict, fear not death; 
    Conflict!—that but nerves to strife: 
    Death!—to endless life!
    Onward, Christians, onward go, 
    Scorning danger, shame, and woe; 
    Tread the path which they have trod 
    Whose rest is now ~~with~~in God.

    CHORUS.
    We’re bound for the kingdom:
    Let us hasten on to glory,
    And sing Hallelujah,
    Sing glory, hallelujah!
    We’re bound for the kingdom:
    Let us onward press to glory,
    And sing Hallelujah 
    To God and the Lamb!
