    1.’Twixt Jesus and the chosen race 
    Subsists a bond of sov’reign grace,
    A bond which hell’s tremendous train,
    Can ne’er dissolve, or rend in twain.

    2. This sacred bond shall never break,
    Though earth should to her centre shake; 
    We rest in hope, assur’d of this,—
    For God has pledg’d His faithfulness.

    3. He spake and sware;—and it was done, 
    Wrought in the blood of His dear Son;
    The Lamb appointed to redeem
    All that the Father lov’d in Him.

    4. O sacred union, firm and strong!
    How great the grace! how sweet the song!
    That Adam’s sons should ever be
    One with Incarnate Deity!

    5. One in His death, one when He rose,
    One when He triumph’d o’er His foes, 
    One when in heav’n He took His seat, 
    And plainly prov’d all hell’s defeat.

    6. Triumphant thus o’er all its pow’rs,
    (For all He is and has is ours),
    With Him, our Head, we stand or fall, 
    Our life, our surety and our all.

    7. Thus sav’d in Him, a chosen race
    O may we prove our faithfulness—
    And live to Him in Whom we died 
    With Whom we shall be glorified.
