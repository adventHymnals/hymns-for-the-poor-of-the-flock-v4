    1. Blest Lamb of God! with grateful praise 
    Our voices now to Thee we raise—
    On Earth to reign, redeem’d by Blood,
    We, kings and priests, are made to God.—

    2. Soon too, in glory shall we sing,
    And louder praises to Thee bring—
    While every nation, tongue and tribe, 
    Strength, glory, might,to Thee ascribe!
    Amen! Amen!
    Saviour! Amen!
