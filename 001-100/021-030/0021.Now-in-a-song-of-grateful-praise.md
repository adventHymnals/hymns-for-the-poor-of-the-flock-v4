    1. Now in a song of grateful praise,
    To our dear Lord the voice we’ll raise; 
    With all His saints we’ll join to tell,
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    2. All worlds His glorious power confess,
    His wisdom all His works express;
    But, O His love!—what tongue can tell? 
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    3. And since our souls have known His love, 
    What mercies hath He made us prove, 
    Mercies which all our praise excel;
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    4. Tho’ many fiery flaming darts 
    The tempter levels at our hearts,
    With this we all his rage repel,
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    5. And when on that bright day we rise,
    And join the anthems of the skies,
    Among the rest this note shall swell,
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”
