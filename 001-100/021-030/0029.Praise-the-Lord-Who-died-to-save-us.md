    1. Praise the Lord Who died to save us;
    Praise His name, forever dear; 
    ’Twas by Him the Father gave us 
    Eyes to see, and ears to hear:
    Praise the Saviour,
    Object of our love and fear.

    2. Grace it was, ’twas Grace abounding,
    Brought Him down to save the lost; 
    Ye above, the throne surrounding, 
    Praise Him, praise Him all His host: 
    Saints adore Him;
    Ye are they who owe Him most.

    3. Ye, of all His hand created,
    Objects are of Grace alone;
    Aliens once, but reinstated;
    Destin’d now to share His throne:
    Sing with wonder;
    Sing of what the Lord hath done.

    4. Praise His name, Who died to save us; 
    ’Tis by Him alone we live;
    And in Him the Father gave us 
    All that boundless love could give:
    Life eternal
    In our Saviour we receive.
