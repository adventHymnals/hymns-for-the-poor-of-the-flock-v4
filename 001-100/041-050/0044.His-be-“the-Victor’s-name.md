[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUZG3hwUeubguK3J-fNB2BuNe59xxvhn/edit?mode=html)



    1. His be “the Victor’s name,”
    Who fought our fight alone; 
    Triumphant saints no honour claim, 
    His conquest was their own.

    2. By weakness and defeat,
    He won the meed and crown;
    Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
    By being trodden down.

    3. He Hell in hell laid low;
    Made sin, He sin o’erthrew;
    Bow’d to the grave, destroy’d it so, 
    And Death, by dying slew.

    4. Bless, bless the Conq’ror slain,
    Slain in His victory;
    Who lived, Who died, Who lives again 
    For thee, His church, for thee!
