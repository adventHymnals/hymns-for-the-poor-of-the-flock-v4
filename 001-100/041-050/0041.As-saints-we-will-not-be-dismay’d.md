    1. As saints we will not be dismay’d,
    Nor sink in hopeless fear;
    For as we ever need His aid,
    The Saviour’s ever near.

    2. This Abr’ham found: he rais’d the knife—
    God saw, and said, “Forbear!
    Yon ram shall yield its meaner life, 
    Behold the victim there.”

    3. Once David seemed Saul’s certain prey;
    But hark! the foe’s at hand;
    Saul turns his arms another way,
    To save th’ invaded land.

    4. When Jonah sunk beneath the wave,
    He thought to rise no more;
    But God prepar’d a fish to save,
    And bear him to the shore.

    5. Since proofs so plain of pow’r and grace,
    Are taught us in His word;
    To Fear or Care we’ll not give place,
    But wait upon the Lord.


    6. Wait for His seasonable aid,
    And, though it tarry, wait:
    The promise may be long delayed, 
    But cannot come too late.
