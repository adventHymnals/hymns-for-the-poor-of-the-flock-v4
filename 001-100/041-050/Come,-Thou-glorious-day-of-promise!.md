    1. Come, Thou glorious day of promise!
    Come and spread Thy cheerful ray, 
    When the scatter’d sheep of Israel 
    Shall no longer go astray;
    When Hosannas 
    With united voice they’ll cry.

    2. Lord, how long wilt Thou be angry?
    Shall Thy wrath for ever burn?
    Rise! redeem Thine ancient people; 
    Their transgressions from them turn: 
    King of Israel!
    Come and set Thy people free.

    3. O that soon Thou wouldst to Jacob
    Thine enliv’ning Spirit send;
    Of their unbelief and mis’ry 
    Make, O Lord, a speedy end;
    Lord Messiah!
    Prince of Peace o’er Israel reign,

    4. Glory, honour, praise, and power,
    Be unto the Lamb for ever!
    Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. 
    Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
    Praise ye the Lord.
    Hallelujah! Praise the Lord.
