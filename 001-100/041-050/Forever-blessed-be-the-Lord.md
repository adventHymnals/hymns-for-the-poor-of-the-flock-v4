    1. For ever blessed be the Lord,
    Our Saviour and our shield;
    Who ==sends His Spirit with His word,==
    To arm us for the field.

    2. When Sin and Hell their force unite,
    He makes His church His care; 
    Instructs us for the heav’nly fight,
    And guards us through the war.

    3. His help against the hostile Pow’rs
    Doth our weak courage raise;
    He makes the glorious vict’ry ours 
    Then His shall be the praise.
