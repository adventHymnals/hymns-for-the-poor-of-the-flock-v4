    1. Christ shed His precious blood,
    To make us His alone;
    And wash’d in that atoning flood, 
    We are no more our own.

    2. If He His will reveal,
    Let us obey the call;
    Assur’d whate’er the flesh may feel, 
    His love deserves our all.

    3. Then let us keep in view
    His glory, as our end;
    Too much we cannot bear, or do, 
    For such a gracious Friend.

    4. And let us stand prepar’d
    In duty’s path to run;
    Nor count the greatest trials hard, 
    So that His will be done.

    5. With Jesus for our guide,
    The path is safe though rough; 
    The Promise says, “I will provide,” 
    And Faith replies, “Enough!”
