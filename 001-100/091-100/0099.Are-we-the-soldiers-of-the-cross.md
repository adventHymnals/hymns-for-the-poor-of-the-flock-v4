    1. Are we the soldiers of the cross,
    The follow’rs of the Lamb?
    And shall we fear to own His cause,
    Or blush to speak His name?

    2. Now must we fight, if we would reign;
    Increase our courage, Lord!
    We’ll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
    Supported by Thy word.

    3. Thy saints, in all this glorious war,
    Shall conquer though they’re slain, 
    They see the triumph from afar,
    For they with Thee shall reign.

    4. Soon that desired morn shall rise,
    And all its beauties shine,
    And one bless’d song shall rend the skies: 
    “The glory, Lord, be Thine!”
