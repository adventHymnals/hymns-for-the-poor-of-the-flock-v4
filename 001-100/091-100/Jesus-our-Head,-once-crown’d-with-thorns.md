    1. Jesus, our Head, once crown’d with thorns,
    Is crown’d with glory now;
    Heaven’s royal diadem adorns 
    The mighty Victor’s brow.

    2. Delight of all who dwell above,
    The joy of saints below,
    To us still manifest Thy love,
    That we its depths may know

    3. To us Thy cross with all its shame,
    With all its grace be giv’n;
    Though earth disowns Thy lowly name, 
    All worship it in heav’n.

    4. Who suffer with Thee, Lord, below,
    Shall reign with Thee above;
    Then let it be our joy to know 
    This way of peace and love.

    5. To us Thy cross is life and health,
    Though shame and death to Thee; 
    Our present glory, joy, and wealth,
    Our everlasting stay.
