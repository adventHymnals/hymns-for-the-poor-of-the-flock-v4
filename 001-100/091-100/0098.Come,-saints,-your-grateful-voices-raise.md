    1. Come, saints, your grateful voices raise,
    The heav’nly Lamb adore;
    Dwell on His everlasting love,
    And praise Him evermore.

    2. Spread His dear name through all the earth,
    Sing His eternal pow’r:
    Shout the rich fountain of His blood,
    And praise Him evermore.

    3. His mercy Who our ransom paid,
    And all our sorrows bore,
    Sing with a note of loftiest joy,
    And praise Him evermore.

    4. Soon shall the Lord appear to reign,
    Then all from shore to shore 
    Shall view the glory of the Lamb 
    And praise Him evermore.
