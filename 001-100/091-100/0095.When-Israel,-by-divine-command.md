    1. When Israel, by divine command,
    The pathless desert trod,
    They found, throughout the barren land, 
    A sure resource in God.

    2. A cloudy pillar mark’d the road,
    And screen’d them from the heat; 
    From the hard rock the water flow’d, 
    And manna was their meat.

    3. Like them, we have a rest in view,
    Secure from hostile Pow’rs;
    Like them, we pass a desert too,
    But Israel’s God is ours.

    4. His word a light before us spreads,
    By which our path we see;
    His love, a banner o’er our heads,
    From harm preserves us free.

    5. Jesus, the bread of life, is giv’n
    To be our daily food;
    Himself the wond’rous stream of heav’n, 
    The precious grace of God.

    6. Lord, ’tis enough, we ask no more;
    Thy grace around us pours 
    Its rich and unexhausted store,
    And all its joy is ours.
