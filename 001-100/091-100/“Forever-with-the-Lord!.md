[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/158Pdyx_Ti7dw8i833wXvyIP7z_Rhi9WK/edit?mode=html)



1\. "Forever with the Lord!"\
Amen, so let it be:\
Life from the dead is in that word,\
'Tis immortality.\
\
2. Here in the body pent,\
Absent from Him I roam,\
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent,\
A day's march nearer home.\
\
3. My Father's house on high,\
Home! to my soul how dear;\
I long to see thee, and I sigh\
Within thee to appear!\
\
4. My thirsty spirit faints\
To reach the home I love;\
The bright inheritance of saints,\
Jerusalem above.\
\
5. And though there intervene\
Rough roads and stormy skies,\
Faith will not suffer ought to screen,\
Thy glory from mine eyes.\
\
6. There shall all clouds depart,\
The wilderness shall cease;\
And sweetly shall each gladd'ned heart,\
Enjoy eternal peace.
