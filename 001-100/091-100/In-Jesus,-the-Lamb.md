[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QJTZGwwT9YJncioE0Ncc%2D9eumTq%2DF8T/edit?mode=html)



    1. In Jesus, the Lamb
    (The Father’s delight,)
    The Saints without blame, 
    Appear in God’s sight;
    And while He in Jesus 
    Our souls shall approve,—
    So long shall our Father 
    Continue His love.

    2. In Jesus, free grace
    All blessings secures;
    We know and rejoice 
    That all things are ours;
    And God from His purpose 
    Will never remove,
    But love us, and bless us,
    “And rest in His love.”
