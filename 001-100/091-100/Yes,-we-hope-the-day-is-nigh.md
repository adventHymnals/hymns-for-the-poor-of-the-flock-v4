    1. Yes, we hope the day is nigh
    When many nations long enslaved, 
    Shall break forth, and sing with joy,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”

    2. Abrah’m’s seed, cast off so long,
    Shall then appear among the saved, 
    Shall arise and join the song,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”

    3. Jews and Gentiles shall unite,
    By Satan’s pow’r no more enslaved,
    And shall sing with great delight,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”

    4. Brighter glory still is nigh,
    For Jesus shall collect His saved;
    Men and angels then shall cry,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”
