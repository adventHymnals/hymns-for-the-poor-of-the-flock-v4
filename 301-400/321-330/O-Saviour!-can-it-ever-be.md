[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DIar_W1N6PKgP5sI3dhLY4tkwuCO0lgW/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Saviour! can it ever be
    That we should be asham’d of Thee? 
    And not with joy Thy name confess 
    Before Thy proudest enemies?

    2. Asham’d of Jesus—Lamb of God,
    Who freed us by His precious blood; 
    Of Him, Who to retrieve our loss 
    Despis’d the shame, endur’d the cross.

    3. Asham’d of Jesus—of that friend 
    Whose love to us can know no en d!330
    It must not be—this be our shame 
    That we no more confess His name.

    4. The world’s anointed King and Lord,
    By all the hosts of heav’n ador’d!
    Yes! we will make our boast of Thee, 
    Now, and to all eternity.

    5. And when we stand before Thy throne, 
    Thou wilt confess us as Thine own,— 
    And, for the world’s rejecting frown, 
    Give to each saint a royal crown.
