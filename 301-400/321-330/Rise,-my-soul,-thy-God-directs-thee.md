    1. Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee,
    Stranger hands no more impede;
    Pass thou on, His hand protects thee, 
    Strength th at has the captive freed.

    2. Is the wilderness before thee,
    Desert lands where drought abides?Heavenly springs shall there restore thee, 
    Fresh from God’s exhaustless tides.

    3. Light divine surrounds thy going,
    God Himself shall mark thy way, 
    Secret blessings, richly flowing,
    Lead to everlasting day.

    4. God, thine everlasting portion,
    Feeds thee with the mighty’s meat, 
    Price of Egypt’s hard extortion,
    Egypt’s food no more to eat.

    5. Art thou wean’d from Egypt’s pleasures?
    God in secret thee shall keep,
    There unfold His hidden treasures,
    There His love’s exhaustless deep.

    6. In the desert God will teach thee
    ' What the God that thou hast found, 
    Patient, gracious, powerful, holy,
    All His grace shall there abound.

    7. On to Canaan’s rest still wending,
    E’en thy wants and woes shall bring 
    Suited grace from high descending,
    Thou shalt taste of mercy’s spring.

    8. Though thy way be long and dreary,
    Eagle strength He’ll still renew:
    Garments fresh, and foot unweary 
    Tell how God hath brought thee through.

    9. When to Canaan’s long-loved dwelling
    Love divine thy foot shall bring,
    There with shouts of triumph swelling 
    Zion’s songs in rest to sing:


    1.0 Then no stranger God shall meet thee,
    Stranger thou in courts above,
    He who to His rest shall greet thee,
    Greets thee with a well-known love.
