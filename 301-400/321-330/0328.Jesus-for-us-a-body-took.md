    1. Jesus for us a body took,
    Our guilt assum’d, our bondage broke, 
    Discharging all our dreadful debt; 
    Then let us ne’er this love forget?

    2. Let us renounce our ways with grief, 
    And cleave to this most sure relief; 
    Nor Him forget Who left the throne, 
    And for our life gave up His own.

    3. Ah no! till time itself depart,
    His name shall cheer and warm each h ea rt; 
    And, shouting this, from earth we’ll rise 
    To join the chorus of the skies.

    4. Ah no! when all things else expire,
    And perish in the general fire,
    His name all others shall survive,
    And through eternity shall live.
