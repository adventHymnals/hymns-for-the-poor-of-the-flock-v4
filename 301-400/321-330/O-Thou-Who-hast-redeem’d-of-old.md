    1. O Thou Who hast redeem’d of old, 
    And made me of Thy grace take hold,
    And be at peace with Thee,
    Help me these blessings now to own, 
    And tell aloud what Thou hast done, 
    O Holy Lamb, for me.

    2. O Thou incarnate Deity,
    Who hast Thy love vouchsaf’d to me, 
    Thy love’s the plea I make,
    Give me this pow’r,’tis all I claim,
    With heart and life to serve Thy name, 
    Give, for Thy mercy’s sake.

    3. Love, only love, Thy heart inclin’d,
    And brought Thee, Saviour of mankind,
    Down from the throne above;
    Love made Thee here a man of grief, 
    Distress’d Thee sore for our relief,
    O mystery of love!

    4. Then since Thou, Lord, didst die for me, 
    Cause me, my Saviour, to love Thee,
    And gladly to resign 
    Whate’er I have, whate’er I am,
    My life be all with Thine the same,
    And all Thy shame be mine.
