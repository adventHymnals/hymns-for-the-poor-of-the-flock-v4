    1. O Je s us! everlasting God!
    Who didst for sinners shed Thy blood 
    Upon the shameful tre e;
    And finish there redemption’s toil,
    And wTin for us the happy spoil,
    All praise we give to Thee.328

    2. Fain would we think upon Thy pain, 
    Would find therein our life and gain,
    And firmly fix the heart 
    Upon Thy grief and dying love,
    Nor evermore from Thee remove,
    Though from all else we part.

    3. The more through grace ourselves we know, 
    The more rejoic’d we are to bow
    And glory in Thy cross;
    To trust in Thine atoning blood,
    And look to Thee for ev’ry good,
    And count all else but loss.
