    1. Would we view God’s brightest glory,
    We must look in Jesu’s face;
    Sing, and tell the pleasing story,
    O ye sinners sav’d by grace;
    And with pleasure,
    Bid the guilty Him embrace.

    2. In His highest work, redemption,
    See His glory fully blaze:
    Nor can angels ever mention 
    Aught that more of God displays;
    Grace and justice 
    Here unite to endless days.

    3. In the person of the Saviour,—
    God’s full majesty is seen;
    Love and justice shine for ever;
    And, without a veil between,
    Man may meet Him,
    And rejoice in His great name.

    4. O how true and blest the pleasure,
    God to view in Christ the Lord; 
    There He smiles, and smiles for ever; 
    Let the church this tru th record;
    Praise and bless Him!
    And His wonders spread abroad.
