[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ChY1NCL68H8jTLlIVguQuf7BUVAEmFi/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sov’reign grace o’er sin abounding!
    Ransom’d souls the tidings swell, 
    ’Tis a deep that knows no sounding; 
    Who its breadth or length can tell?

    2. Sav’d by Christ, we’re free for ever,
    This the Spirit’s voice declares! 
    Death, nor hell, nor sin shall sever, 
    Jesus from the chosen heirs.

    3. Saints above, in His communion,
    Rest from conflict with their Head; 
    While we sing the blessed union, 
    Though in thorny paths we tread.
