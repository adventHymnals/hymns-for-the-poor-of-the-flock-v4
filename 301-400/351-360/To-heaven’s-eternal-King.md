    1. To heaven’s eternal King
    The praise of saints be giv’n;
    His name, His glorious name we sing, 
    The rightful Heir of heav’n.

    2. He once was found with men,
    A man of sorrows H e;
    He bore His people’s sentence then,
    He bore it on the tree.

    3. He suffer’d in their stead,
    He sav’d His people th u s;
    The curse that fell upon His head, 
    Was due, by right, to us.

    4.’Twas love that brought Him down,
    The purest, strongest love;
    He bore the cross, He won the crown, 
    And now He reigns above.

    5. The praise of saints be given
    To Him Who worthy is;
    He died on earth—He lives in heav’n, 
    Eternal praise be His.
