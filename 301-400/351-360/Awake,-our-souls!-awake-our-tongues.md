[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11HuUGsgD9jsBVWFn775i8VMgWuFOhL9s/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake our souls! awake our tongues;
    The subject is divine:
    The Saviour’s love demands our songs; 
    Let all His people join.

    2. This Saviour is the Mighty God,
    Who rests in heav’n above;
    Reveal’d in flesh, He shed His blood, 
    And thus declar’d God’s love.356

    3. Jesus, Thy love exceeds our thought;
    But this at least we see,
    The soul that knows Thy pow’r is taught 
    To value nought but Thee.

    4. And though Thy love be faintly seen,
    W h a t’s seen demands our praise; 
    Without it, Lord, we still had been 
    Engag’d in folly’s ways.
