[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10wmIPjV07DaCp78JWUtQ6SoN_3dk4lOZ/edit?mode=html)



    1. To the Redeemer’s glorious name
    Awake the sacred song!
    O may His love (immortal flame!)
    Tune every heart and tongue.

    2. His love what human thought can reach?
    What tongue on earth display? 
    Imagination’s utmost stretch 
    In wonder dies away.

    3. Let wonder still with love unite,
    And gratitude with joy;
    Jesus be our supreme delight,
    His praise our blest employ.

    4. Jesus, Who left the throne on high,
    Left the bright realms of bliss,
    And came to earth to bleed and die:
    Was ever love like this?

    5. Dear Lord, we gladly, humbly pay
    Our grateful thanks to Thee,
    For, taught of God, we each can say,
    “The Saviour died for me.”
