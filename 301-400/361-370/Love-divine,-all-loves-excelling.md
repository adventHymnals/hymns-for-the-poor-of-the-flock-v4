[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wG_Bz%2DPF1ZBWuC6Y7mHdLIeLZZKRarra/edit?mode=html)



    1. Love divine, all loves excelling,
    Joy of Heav’n, to earth come down! 
    Bless us with Thy rich indwelling,
    All Thy faithful mercies crown!
    Jesus, Thee we’d still be blessing,
    Serve Thee as Thy hosts above,
    Praise Thee, Saviour, without ceasing, 
    Glory in Thy dying love.

    2. Carry on Thy new creation—
    Faithful, holy, may we be,
    Joyful in our full salvation,
    Perfectly conform’d to Thee!
    Changed from glory into glory,
    ’Till in heav’n we take our place,
    Then we’ll cast our crowns before Thee, 
    Lost in wonder, love and praise 1
