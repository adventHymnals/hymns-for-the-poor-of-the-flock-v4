[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x__icZKY-9pyUuCne6NwrpnWX38OCuGJ/edit?mode=html)



    To glory in Jesus, we think 
    Our duty and joy evermore,â€”
    For He is our meat and our drink,
    Our life, and our strength, and our store; 
    Our Shepherd, our Husband, our Friend, 
    Our Saviour from sin and from thrall; 
    Our hope from beginning to end,
    Our portion, our Lord, and our all.
