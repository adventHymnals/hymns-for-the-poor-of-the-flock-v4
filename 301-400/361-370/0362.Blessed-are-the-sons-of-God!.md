[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUOcqggEPq7pOSB88S5KwehBs091ckAm/edit?mode=html)



    1. Blessed are the sons of God!
    They are bought with Jesu’s blood;
    They are ransom’d from the grave;
    Life eternal they shall have.

    2. God did love them in His Son 
    Long before the world begun;
    They the seal of this receiv’d 
    When on Jesus they believ’d.

    3. They are lights upon the earth,
    Children of an heav’nly b irth;
    Born of God, they hate all sin,
    God’s pure seed remains within.

    4. They have fellowship with God 
    Through the Mediator’s blood:
    One with God, with Jesus one,
    Glory is in them begun.

    5. They alone are truly bless’d,
    Heirs of God, joint heirs with C hrist; 
    Blessed this fraternity,
    Here and in eternity!
