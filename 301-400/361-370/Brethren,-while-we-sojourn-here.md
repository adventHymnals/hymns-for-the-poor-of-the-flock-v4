    1. B r e th r e n , while we sojourn h e re,
    Fight we must, but should not fea r;
    Foes we have, but we’ve a Friend,
    One that loves us to the end.
    Forward, then, with courage go,
    Long we shall not dwell below;
    Soon the joyful news will come,
    “Child, your Father calls—Come home.”

    2. In the way a thousand snares 
    Lie, to take us unawares;
    Satan, with malicious art 
    Watches each unguarded part;
    But, from Satan’s malice free,
    Saints shall soon victorious be;
    Soon the joyful news will come,
    "Child, your Father calls— Come home.”

    3. But, of all the foes we meet,
    None so oft mislead our feet,
    None betray us into sin
    Like the foes that dwell within:
    Yet let nothing spoil your peace,
    Christ will also conquer th ese;
    And the joyful news will come,
    “Child, thy Father calls—Come home.”
