[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xdFpLZ81QQSChWgMoLX2qE7zXcq6E9La/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus in the heav’nly temple
    Sits with God upon the throne,
    Now no more to be forsaken,
    His humiliation gone.

    2. Dwelling in eternal sunshine
    Of the countenance of G od;
    There He fills the heav’ns with incense 
    Of His reconciling blood.

    3. With this wondrous Christ we are one,
    Being of the Spirit bo rn; 
    And of God belov’d in Jesus,
    We can love Him in return.
