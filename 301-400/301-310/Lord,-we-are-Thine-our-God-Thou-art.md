    1. Lord, we are Thine: our God Thou art, 
    Fashioned and made we are by Thee—
    These curious frames!—in ev’ry part,
    Thy wisdom, power, and love we see,— 
    Each breath we draw, each pulse that beats, 
    Each organ formed by skill divine,
    Each precious sense aloud repeats—
    Great God, that we are only Thine.

    2. Lord, we are Thine: in Thee we live,
    Supported by Thy tender care,
    Thou dost each hourly mercy give •
    Thine earth we tread, we breathe Thine air; 
    Raiment and food Thy hands supply;
    Thy sun’s bright rays around us shine; 
    Guarded by Thine all-seeing eye—
    We own, that we are only Thine.

    3. Lord, we are Thine: bought by Thy blood,
    Once the poor guilty slaves of sin,
    But Thou redeemedst us to God,
    And mad’st Thy Spirit dwell within;
    Thou hast our sinful wand’rings borne,
    With love and patience all divine;
    As brands, then, from the burning tom,
    We own that we are wholly Thine.

    4. Lord, we are Thine: Thy claims we own—
    Ourselves to Thee we wholly give;304-
    Reign Thou within our hearts alone,
    And let us to Thy glory live;
    Here let us each Thy mind display,
    In all Thy gracious image shine;
    And haste that long expected day,
    When Thou shalt own that we are Thine.
