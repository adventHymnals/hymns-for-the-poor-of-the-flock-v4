    1. O h a p p y day! when first we felt 
    Our souls with true contrition m e lt;
    And all our sins of crimson guilt 
    Were cleansed by blood on Calv’ry spilt.

    2. O happy day! when Jesus’ love 
    Began our grateful hearts to move,
    And gazing on the wond’rous cross,
    We saw all else as worthless dross.

    3. O happy day! when, sin no more,
    We meet Him Whom our souls adore; 
    When sorrows, conflicts, fears, shall cease, 
    And all our trials end in peace.

    4. O happy day! when we shall see,
    And cast our longing eyes on Thee;
    On Thee our light, our life, our love,
    Our all below, our heaven above.308

    5. O happy day of cloudless light!
    Eternal day without a night!
    Lord, when shall we its dawning see, 
    And spend it all in praising Thee?

    6. Come, Saviour, come! O quickly come! 
    Take us Thy waiting people home;
    We long to stand around Thy throne,
    To love and serve Thee, Lord, alone.
