    1. Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?
    O height, O depth of love!
    One with us on the cursed tree,
    We one with Thee above?

    2. Such was Thy grace, that for our sake
    Thou didst from heav’n come down, 
    Our mortal flesh and blood partake,
    In all our misery one.

    3. Our sins, our guilt, in love divine,
    Confess’d and borne by Thee;
    The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine, 
    To set Thy members free.

    4. Ascended now, in glory bright,
    Still one with us Thou a r t;
    Nor life, nor death, nor depth, nor height, 
    Thy saints and Thee can part.

    5. O teach us, Lord, to know and own
    This wondrous mystery,
    That Thou with us art truly one,
    And we are one with Thee.

    6. Soon, soon shall come that glorious day,
    When, seated on Thy throne,
    Thou shalt to wond’ring worlds display: 
    That Thou with us art one!
