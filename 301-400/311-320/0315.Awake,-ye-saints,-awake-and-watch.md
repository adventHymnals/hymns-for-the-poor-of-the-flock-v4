    1. Awake, ye saints, awake and watch,
    The Bridegroom may be near;
    How awful, should His coming catch 
    His people slumb’ring here!

    2. They who are ready to attend
    The Lord when He appears,
    With Him to glory shall ascend;
    Eternal life is theirs.

    3. ith Him they shall sit down, and feast 
    On heav’n’s unbounded store;
    Enjoy an everlasting rest,
    And never hunger more.

    4. When once the chamber door shall close,
    ’Tis sure beyond a doubt,
    No further hope remains for those 
    Who then are found without.

    5. Awake, and be ye like to those
    Who wait their Lord’s return;
    Awake, nor yield to that repose,
    Whose end it is to mourn,
