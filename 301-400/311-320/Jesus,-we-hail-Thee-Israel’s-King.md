    1. Jesus, we hail Thee Israels King;
    To Thee our tribute, Lord, we bring;
    Nor do we fear to bow the knee;
    They worship God, who worship Thee.

    2. Hail! Israel’s King, enthron’d in light, 
    Whose glory never shone more bright 
    Than when, by faithless friends betray’d, 
    Thy foes insulting homage paid.

    3. Then did admiring angels see 
    Divine forbearance, Lord, in Thee;
    With emphasis pronounce Thee good; 
    And heav’n and earth contrasted stood.

    4. An object of contempt beneath,
    And judg’d by men to suffer death;
    By angels own’d, admir’d, ador’d,
    The great, the everlasting Lord!

    5. Reign, mighty Lord, for ever reign!
    Thy cause throughout the world maintain 
    Let Israel’s God His triumphs spread, 
    And crowns of glory wreath His head!
