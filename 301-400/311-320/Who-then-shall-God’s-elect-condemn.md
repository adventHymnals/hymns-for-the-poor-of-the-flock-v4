    1. Who then shall Godâ€™s elect condemn?
    Since Jesus for their ransom died; 
    Rising, He intercedes for them,
    And they in Him are justified.

    2. Not tribulation, nakedness,
    The famine, peril, or the sword,
    Nor persecution nor distress,
    Shall separate from Christ the Lord.

    3. Nor life, nor death, nor depth, nor height,
    Nor powers below, nor powers above, * 
    Nor present things, nor things to come,- 
    Can change His purposes of love.314

    4. His sovereign mercy knows no bounds,
    His faithfulness shall still endure;
    And those who on His word rely,
    Shall find this truth for ever sure.
