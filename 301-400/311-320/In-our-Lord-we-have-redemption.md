    1. In our Lord we have redemption,
    Full remission in His blood;
    From the curse entire exemption,
    From the curse pronounc’d by God: 
    W hat a Saviour Jesus is!
    O what love, what love is His!

    2. Praise be His, all praise transcending, .
    Praise on earth, and praise in heav’n; 
    Praise through ages never-ending,
    To the Lamb of God be giv’n:
    He alone the Saviour is,
    Everlasting praise be His.
