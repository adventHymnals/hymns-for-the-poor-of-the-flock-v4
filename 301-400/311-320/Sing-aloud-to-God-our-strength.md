    1. Sing aloud to God, our strength;
    He has brought us hitherto;
    He will bring us home at length;
    This the Lord our God will do: 
    Doubt not, for His word is stable; 
    Fear not, for His arm is able.

    2. Sing aloud to God, our strength • 
    Sing with wonder of His love;
    Who can tell its breadth and length?
    Who below, or who above?
    Who its depth and height can measure? 
    ’Tis a rich unbounded treasure!

    3. Sing aloud to God, our strength;
    He is with us where we go;
    Fear we not the journey’s length,
    Fear we not the mighty foe:
    All our foes shall be defeated,
    And our journey be completed.
