    1. Soon shall our Master come,
    Our toil and sorrow cease;
    He’ll call His waiting servants home, 
    And all be joy and peace.

    2. Now may we do His will,
    In all His footsteps tread;
    And, in a world of evil, still 
    To grieve Him only dread.312

    3. May we His name confess
    ’Midst suffering, shame, and loss; 
    Stand forth His faithful witnesses,
    And glory in the Cross.

    4. Watchful may each be found,
    Our loins well girded b e;
    In works of faith and love abound,
    Till we our Master see.

    5. Then shall we soar above,
    Nor cease our sweet employ;
    And hear Him say, with tend’rest love, 
    “Enter Thy Master's joy.”
