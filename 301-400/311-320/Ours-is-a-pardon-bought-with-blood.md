    1. Ours is a pardon bought with blood,
    Amazing tru th! the blood of One 
    Who, without usurpation, could 
    Lay claim to heav'n’s eternal throne.

    2. No victim of inferior worth
    Could ward the stroke that justice aim’d; 
    For none but He, in heav’n or earth,
    Could offer that which justice claim’d.

    3. But He, the Lord of glory, came;
    On yonder cross He bow’d His head;
    He suffer’d pain, He suffer’d shame,
    And lay a pris’ner with the dead.

    4. But lo 1 He rises from the grave,
    And bears the greatest, sweetest name; 
    The Lord, almighty now to save,
    From sin, from death, from endless shame.
