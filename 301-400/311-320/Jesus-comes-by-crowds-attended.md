    1. Jesus comes by crowds attended,
    Heav’n the dazzling train supplies:
    Call the dead; the night is ended;
    Bid the sleeping dust arise:
    Let the ransom’d 
    Join the Saviour in the skies.

    2.’Tis the day so long expected;
    Shout, ye saints, and triumph now;
    See your Lord, by man rejected;
    Many crowns adorn His brow;
    ’Tis His triumph:
    Ev’ry knee to Him shall bow.
