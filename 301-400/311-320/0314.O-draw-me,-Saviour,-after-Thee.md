    1. O d r a w me, Saviour, after Thee,
    So shall I run, and never tire:
    With gracious words still comfort me,
    Be Thou my hope, my sole desire;
    Free me from every w eight: nor fear,
    Nor sin can come, if Thou art near.

    2. W hat in Thy love possess I not?
    My star hy night, my sun by day,
    My spring of life, when parchâ€™d with drought, 
    My wine to cheer, my bread to stay,
    My strength, my shield, my safe abode,
    My robe before the throne of G od!

    3. From all Eternity with love
    Unchangeable Thou hast me viewed;
    Ere knew this beating heart to move,
    Thy tender mercies me pursued:
    Ever with me may they abide,
    And close me in on every side.
