[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5giFh2uuLkIxNV2ZWvAYGKhMdUmdWlv/edit?mode=html)



    1. Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice and praise 
    The blessing of redeeming grace;
    Jesus, your everlasting tow’r,
    Mocks at the angry tempest’s roar.

    2. His love’s a refuge ever nigh,
    His watchfulness, a mountain high;
    His name’s a rock, which winds above 
    And waves below can never move.

    3. His faithfulness for ever sure,
    For endless ages will endure;
    His perfect work will ever prove 
    The depth of His unchanging love.

    4. While all things change, He changes not, 
    He ne’er forgets, though oft forgot;
    His love’s unchangeably the same,
    And as enduring as His name.

    5. Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice and praise 
    The blessings of this wondrous grace; 
    Jesus, your everlasting tow’r,
    Can bear unmov’d the tempest’s roar.
