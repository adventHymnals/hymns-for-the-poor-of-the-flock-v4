    1. We go to meet the Saviour,
    His glorious face to see;
    What manner of behaviour 
    Doth with this hope agree?
    May God’s illumination,
    Guide heart and hand aright; 
    That so our preparation 
    Be pleasing in His sight.

    2. W e’d gladly wile the hours,
    Till night shall pass away,
    And chant with all our powers 
    The blessings of that day;
    To Thee, the King of glory,
    W e’d raise the happy song, 
    And make Thy love’s bright story 
    The theme of ev’ry tongue.

    3. This caus’d Thine incarnation,
    This brought Thee from on high, 
    Thy thirst for our salvation,
    This made Thee come to d ie;
    O love beyond all measure, 
    Wherewith Thou didst embrace 
    The victims of the pressure 
    Of sin and its disgrace!

    4. Not sinful man’s endeavour,
    Nor any mortal’s care,
    Could draw Thy sov’reign favour 
    To sinners in despair;
    Uncall’d Thou cam’st with gladness, 
    Us from the fall to raise,
    And change our grief and sadness, 
    To songs of joy and praise.
