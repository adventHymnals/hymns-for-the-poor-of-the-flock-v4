    1. Jesus, Who vanquish’d all our foes,
    Who came to save, Who reigns to bless, 
    From Thee our ev’ry comfort flows,
    Life, liberty, and joy, and peace.
    Resound, ye saints, the joyful strain,
    Let Him, the King of glory, reign.

    2. O Thou art worthy, gracious Lord,
    Of universal, endless praise,
    With ev’ry pow’r to be ador’d 
    That men or angels e’er can raise.
    And heav’n and earth shall blend their strains, 
    Jesus, the King of glory, reigns.

    3. But earth and heav’n can ne’er proclaim
    The boundless glories of their King;
    Yet do our hearts adore His name,
    The name whence all our blessings spring.
    Resound, resound the joyful strain,
    Let Him, the King of glory, reign

    4. How mean the tribute that we pay!
    How cold the heart, how faint the tongue! 
    But O a bright eternal day 
    Will bring a more exalted song, 
    Resounding in immortal strains,
    Jesus, the King of glory, reigns!
