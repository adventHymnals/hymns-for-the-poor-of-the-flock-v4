    1. To us, our God His love commends,
    When by our sins undone;
    That He might spare His enemies, 
    He would not spare His Son,—

    2. His only Son, on whom He plac’d
    His whole delight and love,334
    Before He form’d the earth below,
    Or spread the heav’ns above.

    3. Our sorrows and our sins to bear,
    Our heavy cross sustain;
    Upon the tree He came to die,
    That we might life obtain.

    4. This life is hid in God with Him,
    Who fell a sacrifice,
    And dying, conquer’d death for us, 
    That we, like Him, might rise.

    5. Quickly He triumph’d o’er the grave,
    And went to heav’n again;
    There intercedes, and thence will come 
    With all His saints to reign.

    6. His wTord assures He’ll quickly come
    For this His brethren pray;
    The whole creation for it groans, 
    Come, Lord, without delay.
