[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuwzm8yojIrySbTF9IDjl-bIAsK7Q3se/edit?mode=html)



    1. Poor, weak, and worthless, though I am,
    I have a rich Almighty friend,
    Jesus, the Saviour, is His name,
    He freely loves, and without end.

    2. He ransom’d me from hell with blood,
    And by His pow’r my foes controll’d; 
    He found me wand’ring far from God,
    And brought me to His chosen fold.

    3.He cheers my heart—my want supplies, 
    And says that I shall shortly be 
    Enthron’d with Him above the skies:
    O what a friend is Christ to m e!
