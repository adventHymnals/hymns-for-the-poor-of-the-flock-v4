    1. Lord o f my life, 0 may Thy praise
    Employ my noblest pow’r s ;
    Whose goodness lengthens out my days,
    And fills the circling hours.

    2. Preserv’d by Thine almighty arm,
    I pass’d the shades of night,
    Serene, and safe from every harm,
    And see returning light.

    3. While many spent the night in sighs,
    And restless pains and woes;
    In gentle sleep I clos’d mine eyes,
    And undisturb’d repose.

    4. When sleep, death’s semblance, o’er me spread
    And I unconscious lay,
    Thy watchful care was round my bed,
    To guard my feeble clay.

    5. 0 let the same almighty care
    My waking hours attend ;
    From every danger, every snare,
    My trembling steps defend.

    6. Smile on the minutes as they roll,
    And guide my future days ;
    And let Thy goodness fill my soul 
    With gratitude and praise.
