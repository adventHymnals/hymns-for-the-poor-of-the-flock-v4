    1.’Tis finish’d! wondrous word!
    The Son of God is slain; 
    Jehovah’s mercy-seat appears,
    The vail is rent in twain.

    2. Now truth and mercy meet
    In holy unity,
    Since Jesu’s blood the ransom is, 
    That sets the pris’ner free.

    3. Within the holy place
    Made by Jehovah’s hands,
    There Jesus, Who was crucified, 
    In kingly priesthood stands.

    4. There He in heaven appears,
    For us to intercede;
    And countless benefits proclaim,
    “The Lord is risen indeed.”
