    1. Now the throne of God the Father
    Jesus crucified requites;
    Where exalted, crown’d with glory,
    In the church He still delights.

    2. Come, behold Him, our forerunner,
    Gone within the holy place,
    Heaven itself the holy temple,
    There He sees the Father’s face.

    3. As the eye of God the Father
    Ever loves on Christ to rest;
    So, by God, are all His members 
    In their Head belov’d and blest.
