    1. Father! we, Thy children, bless Thee,
    For Thy love on us bestow’d,
    As our Father we address Thee,
    Call’d to be the sons of God. 
    Wondrous was Thy love in giving 
    Jesus for our sins to die,
    Wondrous was His grace in leaving,
    For our sakes, His home on high.

    2. Now the sprinkled blood has freed us.
    On we go toward our rest,
    Through the desert Thou dost lead us, 
    With Thy constant favour blest:
    By Thy truth and Spirit guiding,
    Earnest He of what’s to come,
    And with daily food providing,
    Thou dost lead Thy children home.

    3. Though our pilgrimage be dreary,
    This is not our resting-place;377
    Shall we of the way be weary,
    When we see our Master’s face? 
    Now, by faith anticipating,
    In this hope our souls rejoice,
    We, His promised advent waiting, 
    Soon shall hear His welcome voice.

    4. Father, O how vast the blessing,
    When Thy Son returns again!
    Then Thy saints, their rest possessing, 
    O’er the earth with Him shall reign 
    For the fathers’ sakes beloved,
    Israel, in Thy grace restor’d,
    Shall on earth, the curse removed,
    Be the people of the Lord.

    5. Then shall countless myriads, wearing
    Robes made white in Jesu’s blood, 
    Palms (like rested pilgrims) bearing, 
    Stand around the throne of God: — 
    These, redeem’d from every nation, 
    Shall in triumph bless Thy name; 
    Every voice shall cry “Salvation,
    To our God, and to the Lamb!"
