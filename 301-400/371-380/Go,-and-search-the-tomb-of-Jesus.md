    1. Go, and search the tomb of Jesus, 
    Where the Lord of Glory la y;
    Jesus is not there, but risen,
    And has borne our sins away,
    It is finish’d!
    Captive leads captivity.

    2. Could not all our sins retain Him, 
    Prison’d in the guarded cave?
    No, He conquer’d death in dying,
    By His cross He spoil’d the grave: 
    Lo! H e’s risen!
    Yes, the Lord is risen indeed.
