    1. O glorious grace! nor spot nor stain
    Is seen on the adopted child;
    Jesus, Who died and rose again,
    The holy, harmless, undefil’d,
    Within the Holiest is gone,
    And stands before the Father’s throne.

    2. The Saviour died upon the tree,
    And sank for us beneath the flood; 
    Our sins are drown’d as in a sea 
    Of love, of sorrow, and of blood! 
    Perfect in Jesu’s sacrifice,
    Her foes the blameless church defies.

    3. Then, God, we give Thee of Thine own,
    Hearts by Thy Jesu’s cross subdued, 
    Polluted once, and hearts of stone,
    But by Thy Spirit now renew’d;373—374
    Look on, Thou glorious Priest and King, 
    While we to God this off1 ring bring.
