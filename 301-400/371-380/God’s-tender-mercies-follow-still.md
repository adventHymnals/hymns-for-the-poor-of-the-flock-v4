    1. Godâ€™s tender mercies follow still,
    Each step of our appointed race;
    In weakness now we do His will,
    But hope to see Him face to face.

    2. Then God shall wipe all tears away,
    As we are known, we then shall know, 
    Nor shall we from those fountains stray, 
    Whence living waters ceaseless flow.
