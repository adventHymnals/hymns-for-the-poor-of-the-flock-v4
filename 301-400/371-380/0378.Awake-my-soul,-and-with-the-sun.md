    And hast refresh’d me while I slept!
    Guard the first springs of thought and will, 
    And with Thyself my spirit fill.

    3. Direct, control, suggest this day 
    All I may think, or do, or say ;
    That all my powers, with all their might, 
    For Thy sole glory may unite.

    4. Heaven, Lord, is there where’er Thou art; 
    0 never then from me depart;
    For to my soul ’twere hell, to be 
    But for one moment void of Thee.

    5. Praise God from Whom all blessings flow, 
    Praise Him, all creatures here below: 
    Praise Him above, ye heav’nly host,
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
