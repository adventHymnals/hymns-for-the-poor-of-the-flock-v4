    1. E re our evening meetingâ€™s close, 
    Ere again we seek repose,
    Lord, our song ascends to Thee, 
    While we gladly bow the knee.

    2. For the mercies of this day,
    For refreshment on our way,
    Thanks to Thee alone be given,
    Lord of earth and God of heaven.

    3. Cold our services have been, 
    Mingled every prayer with sin ;
    But Thou canst and dost forgive; 
    For by grace alone we live.

    4. Whilst this thorny path we tread, 
    May Thy love our footsteps lead; 
    While their steps Thy pilgrims bend 
    To the rest which knows no end.
