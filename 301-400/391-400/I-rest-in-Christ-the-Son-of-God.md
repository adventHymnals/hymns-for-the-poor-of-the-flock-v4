    “ For we which have believed do enter into rest."— 
    Heb. iv. 3., con. Mat. xi. 23—30.

    1. I rest in Christ the Son of God,
    Who took the servant’s form;
    By faith I flee to Jesu’s cross,
    My covert from the storm.

    2. At peace with God, no ills I dread,
    The cup of blessing m ine;.
    The Lord is risen, His precious blood 
    Is new and living wine.

    3. Jesus put all my sins away
    When bruised to make me whole:
    Who shall accuse or who condemn 
    My blameless ransom’d soul ?

    4. O thou destroyer, see the blood
    That makes the guilty clean,
    No prey of thine the soul on which 
    This token once is seen.
    lord ’s su pp e r .
