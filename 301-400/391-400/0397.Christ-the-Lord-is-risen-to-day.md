    1. Ch ris t the Lord is risen to-day, 
    Sons of men and angels say;
    Raise your songs of triumph high, 
    Sing ye heav’ns, and earth reply.

    2. Love’s redeeming work is done, 
    Fought the fight, the battle won; 
    Lo! our sun’s eclipse is o’er,
    Lo! He sets in blood no more.21
    lord’s d a y  evenin g .

    3. Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, 
    Christ hath burst the gates of hell, 
    (Death in vain forbids His rise), 
    He hath opened Paradise.

    4. What tho’ once we perish’d all, 
    Partners of our parents’ fall; 
    Second life we now receive,
    And in Christ for ever live.
