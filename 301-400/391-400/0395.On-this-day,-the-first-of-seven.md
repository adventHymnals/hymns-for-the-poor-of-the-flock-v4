    1. On this day, the first of seven, 
    Sinners we, through grace forgiven, 
    Come before the God of heaven:
    Saviour, let us hear Thy voice.

    2. From our hearts remove all sadness; 
    Fill us, Lord, with holy gladness:
    All the worldlingâ€™s mirth is madness;
    But Thy people should rejoice.

    3. Of Thy love for ever tasting,
    Theirs are pleasures everlasting; 
    Theirs a treasure never wasting,
    Which nor moth nor rust destroys.

    4. Trusting to Thy faithful promise,
    Joy and gladness well become us:
    Who shall wrest the blessing from us,
    Who that force or guile employs ?
