    1. T h e week’s first day is that on w hich 
    The Saviour left the grave:
    We sing of Him in mercy rich ;
    His arm is strong to save.

    2. He drank a bitter cup for us,
    How bitter, who can tell ?
    ’Twas thus He paid our debt, and thus 
    He saved our souls from hell.

    3. We hail the day, the week’s first day,
    The day the Saviour rose:
    The Lord, He bore our sins away ; 
    From this our comfort flows.

    4. From this there flows a rich supply
    Of all we can require;
    Tis pardon, peace, and holy joy— 
    What more can we desire ?

    5. What more, but that we may sustain
    Untir’d the holy strife ;
    And then, with all the victors, gain 
    A crown, the crown of life?
