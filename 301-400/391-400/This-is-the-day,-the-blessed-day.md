    1. T h is is the day, the blessed  day
    When Jesus left the grave:
    Of Him we sing, and well we may, 
    For us He came to save.

    2. ’Tis sweet to know that by His death
    We live—this grace is sweet:
    The Saviour, with His dying breath, 
    Proclaim’d His work complete.

    3. He lives, He reigns the God of love,
    He reigns for evermore:
    His pow’r, all other pow’rs above,
    His name, all names before.

    4. To Him Who died and rose again,
    The Lord of earth and heav’n ;
    To Him by angels and by men,
    Be endless glory giv’n.

    5. The glory due to Him alone,
    Who reigns in heaven above:
    Who fills the everlasting throne,
    The God of grace and love.
