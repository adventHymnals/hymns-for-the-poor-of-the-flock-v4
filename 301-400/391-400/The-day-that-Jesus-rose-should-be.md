    1. T h e day th at Jesus rose should be
    Remember’d by His friends;
    Upon His rising, all agree,
    Their hope of heaven depends.

    2. If Jesus rose not from the dead,
    His people’s hope is vain ;
    He then would have no power to save, 
    Nor should they live again.

    3. But now is Jesus ris’n indeed,
    And He “ the first-fruits” is ;
    The first-fruits of the ransom’d seed, 
    Of those He claims as His.

    4. As He is ris’n, so they shall rise;
    As He lives, so shall they:
    A dwelling theirs beyond the skies, 
    And theirs a glorious day.
    b The hope that Jesus shall appear, 
    And take His saints to heav’n,
    To dwell with Him for ever there; 
    This hope to saints is giv’n.
