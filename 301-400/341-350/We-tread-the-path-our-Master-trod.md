    1. We tread the path our Master trod,
    What can we wish for more?
    And ev’ry thorn that wounds our feet 
    His temples pierc’d before.

    2. Our Shepherd’s pow’r is always near,
    His arm outstretch’d in love!
    And while our bodies wander here, 
    Our hearts are fix’d above.

    3. Afflictions purge our dross away, 
    Refining as we ru n;
    And, while we die to earth and sense, 
    Our heav’n is here begun.
