    X Cross, reproach, and tribulation,
    Of the church are certain guests,
    When she has this consolation,
    That on Christ alone she rests.

    2. The reproach of Christ is glorious—
    All who here His burden bear,
    In the end will prove victorious,
    And eternal glories share.

    3. Christ, the ever blessed Saviour,
    Bore for us reproach and shame; 
    Now as conqu’ror lives for ever,
    And we conquer in His name.

    4. Bear we, then, reproach for Jesus,
    Living still a life of faith;
    Let us sing glad songs of praises, 
    Though it be’mid shame and death,
