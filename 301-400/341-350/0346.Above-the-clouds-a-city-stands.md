    1. Above the clouds a city stands,
    Of living stones not made with hands, 
    Where God the Saviour’ll reign:
    Tis built for sinners bought with blood, 
    Redeem’d and sanctified to God,
    And cleans’d from every stain.

    2. The cities of this world must fall, 
    However solid, they must all
    The common ruin share;
    But yonder city still appears 
    Unchangeable through endless years, 
    For God Himself is there,

    3. Happy the saints who shall abide 
    Within those walls, and there reside
    For ever with the K ing;
    We hope that we shall soon be there, 
    Its joys and blessedness to share,
    The Saviour’s praise to sing.347—348
