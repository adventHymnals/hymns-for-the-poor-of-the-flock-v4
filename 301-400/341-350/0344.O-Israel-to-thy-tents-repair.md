    1. O Israel, to thy tents repair,
    Why so secure on hostile ground? 
    The King commands thee to beware, 
    For many foes thy camp surround.

    2. The trumpet sounds a martial strain,
    Then Israel gird thee for the fight; 
    Arise, the combat to maintain,
    And put thine enemies to flight.345

    3. Thou should’st not sleep as others do,
    Awake, be vigilant, be brave;
    The coward and the sluggard too,
    Must wear the fetters of the slave.

    4. A nobler lot is cast for thee,
    Fair Canaan’s spread before thine eyes: 
    With such a hope, shall Israel flee?
    Or yield through weariness the prize?

    5. No, though a careless world repose,
    And slumber on through life’s short day, 
    God’s Israel to the conflict goes,
    And bears the glorious prize away.
