    1. H a il 1 holy day, most blest, most dear! 
    When death’s dark region, sad and drear, 
    Those strange mysterious sounds did hear, 
    “ The Lord is risen."12
    lord’s d ay m o r n ing.

    2. The holy Captive’s bonds are riven,
    To Him the keys of death are given,
    Be glad, O earth, and shout, 0 heaven!
    “ The Lord is risen.”

    3. Shall this triumphant theme inspire 
    The angel’s song, the seraph’s lyre,
    And saints not sing with such a choir,
    “ The Lord is risen” ?

    4. For not for them His life He gave;
    He did not die their souls to save;
    It is for man that from the grave
    “ The Lord is risen.”

    5. For man He left His glorious throne,
    For man to death’s dark realm went down 
    And now to heaven for man alone
    “ The Lord is risen! ”
