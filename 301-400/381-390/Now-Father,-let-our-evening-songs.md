    1. Now Father, let our evening songs
    Like holy incense rise;
    And let the off’rings of our tongues 
    Be holy sacrifice.

    2. Through all the dangers of the day
    Thyself for us hast car’d ;
    And still to drive our wants away,
    Thy mercy stands prepar’d.

    3. Perpetual blessings from above
    Encompass us around;
    But a h! how few returns of love 
    Hath our Redeemer found.

    4. What have we done for Him Who died
    To save our sinful souls ?
    Alas ! our sins are multiplied,
    Fast as each minute rolls.


    5. Yet with these sin-stain’d lives of ours, 
    Lord, to Thy blood we flee;
    And yield them up with all their powers, 
    To be renew’d by Thee.
