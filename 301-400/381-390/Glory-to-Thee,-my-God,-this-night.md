    1. G lory  to Thee, my God, this night,
    For all the blessings of the light;
    Keep me, 0 keep me, King of kings, 
    Under Thine own Almighty wings.

    2. Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
    The ills that I this day have done;
    That with the world, myself, and Thee,
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

    3. 0 may my soul on Thee repose,
    And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close; 
    Sleep, that may me more active make,
    To serve my God when I awake.

    4. Should death itself my sleep invade,
    Why should I be of death afraid ? 
    Protected by Thy saving arm,
    Tho’ death may strike, it cannot harm.


    5. For death is life, and labour rest,
    When with Thy gracious presence blest; 
    Then welcome sleep or death to me,
    I’m still secure, for still with Thee.

    6. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow, 
    Praise Him, all creatures here below: 
    Praise Him above, ye heav’nly host, 
    Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
