    1. G od o f m y life, w ith g rateful he art,
    My ev’ning song I raise ;
    But, 0 Thy thousand, thousand gifts 
    Exceed my highest praise.

    2. What shall I render for the care
    Which me this day has kept?
    A thankful heart, though no return,
    Thy grace will still accept.

    3. The sins and follies, holy God,
    Which 1 this day have done,
    I would confess with grief; and pray 
    For pardon through Thy Son.

    4. Much of my precious time I’ve lost:
    This sinful waste forgive ;
    And one day nearer now—to Thee,
    Lord, teach me now to live.
