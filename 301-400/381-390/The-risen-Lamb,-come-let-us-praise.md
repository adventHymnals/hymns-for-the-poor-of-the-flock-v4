[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WM7oKMjpSw18cur0xjt3yFZtsVMsvpv/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Risen Lamb, come let us praise,
    In concert with the blest;
    Who, joyful in harmonious lays, 
    Employ an endless rest.
    Thus, Lord, while we remember Thee, 
    We bless’d and patient grow;
    And learn by hymns of praise to be 
    Triumphant here below.

    2. On this glad day a brighter scene
    Of glory was display’d,
    By God, the eternal Word, than when 
    This universe was made:
    For then He rose, the church Who bought 
    With grief and pain extreme:
    ’Twas great to speak a world from nought; 
    ’Twas greater to redeem.
