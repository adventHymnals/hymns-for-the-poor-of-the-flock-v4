    1. Through the day Thy love has spar’d us, 
    Wearied now we part for rest; 
    Throughthe silent watches guard us,
    Let no foe our peace molest:
    Jesus ! Thou our guardian be,
    Sweet it is to trust in Thee.

    2. Pilgrims here on earth, and strangers, 
    Dwelling in the midst of foes;
    Us, and ours preserve from dangers, 
    In Thine arms may we repose:
    And when man’s sad day is past,
    Rest with Thee in heav’n at last.
