    1. In sleep’s serene oblivion laid,
    I safely pass’d the silent night;
    Again I see the breaking shade,
    I drink again the morning light.

    2. Refresh’d, I bless the waking hour,
    Once more, with awe, rejoice to be;
    My conscious soul resumes her power, 
    And springs, my Saviour God, to Thee !

    3. 0 guide me through the various maze, 
    Which I and Thine are forced to tread ; 
    And spread Thy shield’s protecting blaze, 
    Where dangers press around my head.
