    1. Th rough the dark and silent h ours
    Of the night, preserve us, Lord ! 
    Safely keep both us and ours,
    Peace and confidence afford:
    We are bold, in Thee confiding,
    Safe beneath Thy shade abiding.

    2. Since we cannot tell to-day
    What to-morrow’s dawn may bring; 
    Saviour, draw our hearts away 
    Far from ev’ry earthly thing:
    Make us, in Thy service steady, 
    Always for Thy coming ready.
