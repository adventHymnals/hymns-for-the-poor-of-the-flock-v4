1. Faint not, Christian! though the road 
Leading to thy blest abode,
Darksome be, and dangerous too,
Christ, thy guide, will bring thee through.

2. Faint not, Christian! though in rage, 
Satan doth thy soul engage;
Take thee Faith’s anointed shield,
Bear it to the battle field.

3. Faint not, Christian! though the world 
Has its hostile flag unfurl’d;
Hold the cross of Jesus fast,
Thou shalt overcome at last.

4. Faint not, Christian! though within, 
There’s a heart so prone to sin:
Christ the Lord is over all,
He’ll not suffer thee to fall.

5. Faint not, Christian! though thy God 
Smite thee with the chast’ning rod;
Smite He must, with Father’s care,
That He may His love declare.

6. Faint not, Christian! Jesu’s near;
Soon in glory He’ll appear,
And His love will then bestow,
Victory over ev’ry foe.

7. Faint not, Christian! look on high,
Hear the harpers in the sky:
Patient wait, and thou wilt join, 
Chanting still of love divine.
