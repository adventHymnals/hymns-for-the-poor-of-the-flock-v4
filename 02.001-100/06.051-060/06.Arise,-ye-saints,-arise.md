####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Arise, ye saints, arise,
The Lord our leader is:
The foe before His banner flies, 
For victory is His.

2. Behold, He leads the way!
We’ll follow where He goes, 
We cannot fail to win the day 
Since He subdues our foes.

3. Lead on, Almighty Lord,
Lead on to victory:
Encourag’d by the bright reward, 
With joy we follow Thee.

4. We follow Thee our Guide,
Who didst salvation bring:
We follow Thee, through grace supplied 
From heav’n’s eternal spring.
