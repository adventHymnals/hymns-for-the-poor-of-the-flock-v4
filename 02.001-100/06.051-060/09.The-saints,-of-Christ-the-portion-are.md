1. The saints, of Christ the portion are,
Redeem’d by grace, reclaim’d by pow’r; 
His special choice and tender care,
Own them, and guard them every hour.

2. He guards them in a barren land,
Beset with sins, and fears, and woes;
He leads and guides them by His hand, 
And keeps them safe from all their foes.
