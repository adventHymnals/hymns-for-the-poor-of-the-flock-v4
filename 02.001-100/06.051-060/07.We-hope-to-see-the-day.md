####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. We hope to see the day
When toil and strife shall cease; 
When we shall cast our arms away,
And dwell in endless peace.

2. This hope supports us here,
It makes our burdens light;
It serves our drooping hearts to cheer 
Till faith shall end in sight.

3. Till of the prize possessâ€™d,
We hear of war no more,
And, O sweet thought! for ever rest, 
On yonder peaceful shore.
