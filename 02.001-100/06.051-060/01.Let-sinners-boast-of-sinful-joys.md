1. Let sinners boast of sinful joys,
The poor delights of sense;
’Tis Christ our inmost thoughts employs, 
We draw our comforts thence.

2. With sweet contentment now we bid,
Farewell to pleasures here;
With Christ in God our life is hid,
And all its springs are there.

3.’Tis now conceal’d and lodg’d secure,
In God’s eternal Son;
From age to age it shall endure, 
Though to the world unknown.

4. Then Lord, remove whate’er divides,
Our lingering souls from Thee; 
'Tis fit that where the Head resides,
The members too should be.
