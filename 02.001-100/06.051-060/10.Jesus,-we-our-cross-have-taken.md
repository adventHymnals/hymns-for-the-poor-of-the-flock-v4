        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 060. Jesus, we our cross have taken.. Jesus, we our cross have taken, All to leave, and follow Thee, All things else for Thee forsaken, Thou from hence our all shalt be; Perish ev’ry fond ambition, All we’ve sought, or hoped, or known;  Yet how rich is our condition, God and heav’n are still our own.

1. Jesus, we our cross have taken,
All to leave, and follow Thee,
All things else for Thee forsaken,
Thou from hence our all shalt be;
Perish ev’ry fond ambition,
All we’ve sought, or hoped, or known; 
Yet how rich is our condition,
God and heav’n are still our own.

2. Let the world despise and leave us;
They have left The Saviour too,
Human hearts and looks deceive us 
Thou art not, like them, untrue;
And since Thou dost smile upon us,
God of wisdom, love and might,
Foes may hate, and friends disown us,
In Thy love we have delight.

3. Go then, earthly fame and treasure,
Come, disaster, scorn, and pain;
In Thy service, pain is pleasure—
With Thy favour, loss is gain—
We have call’d our God, our Father,
We have set our hearts on Thee,
Storms may howl, and clouds may gather, 
All must work our liberty.

4. Man may trouble and distress us,
’Twill but drive us to Thy breast;
Life with trials hard may press us,
Heav’n will bring us sweeter rest.
O ’tis not in grief to harm us,
With Thy love so full and free,
O ’twere not in joy to charm us,
Were that joy unmix’d with Thee.
