```txt
1. Father of peace, and God of love!
We own Thy power to save,
That power by which our Shepherd rose 
Victorious o’er the grave.

2. Him from the dead Thou brought’st again
When, by His sacred blood,
Confirm’d and seal’d for evermore,
Th’ eternal covenant stood.

3. O may the Spirit guide our souls,
And mould them to Thy will,
That our weak hearts no more may stray, 
But keep Thy precepts still;

4. That to perfection’s sacred height
We nearer still may rise;
And all we think, and all we do,
Be pleasing in Thine eyes!
