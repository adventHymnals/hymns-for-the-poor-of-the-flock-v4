####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. The Church in her militant state
Is weary, and cannot forbear;
The saints, with desire still wait,
To see Him again in the air!

2. The Spirit invites in the bride,
Her Heav’nly Lord to descend; 
And place her, enthron’d at His side, 
In glory that never shall end.

3. The news of His coming I hear,
And gladly I join in the cry,
O Jesus in triumph appear,
Appear on the clouds of the sky!

4. Come Lord to the Bride of Thy love,
In fulness of majesty come;
And give me the mansion above, 
Prepar’d in Thy heavenly home!
