        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 061. Church of God, by Christ’s salvation. Church of God, by Christ’s salvation, Rise o’er sin, and fear, and care— Joy to find in ev’ry station, Something still to do or bear; Think what Spirit dwells within thee—  Think what Father’s smiles are thine—  Think that Jesus died to win thee— Bride of Christ! wilt thou repine?

1. Church of God, by Christ’s salvation,
Rise o’er sin, and fear, and care—
Joy to find in ev’ry station,
Something still to do or bear;
Think what Spirit dwells within thee— 
Think what Father’s smiles are thine— 
Think that Jesus died to win thee—
Bride of Christ! wilt thou repine?

2. Haste thee on from grace to glory,
Arm’d by faith, and wing’d by prayer, 
Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee,
God’s right hand shall guide thee there; 
Soon shall close thine earthly mission, 
Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days,
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and pray’r to praise.
