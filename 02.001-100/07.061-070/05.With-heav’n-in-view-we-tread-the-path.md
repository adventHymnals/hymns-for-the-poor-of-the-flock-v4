1. With heav’n in view, we tread the path
The saints of former ages trod;
Like them, the children once of wrath, 
But now, like Christ, the sons of God.

2. No room for any boast have we,
Upon another’s wealth we live; 
The pardon we enjoy is free,
The praise to God alone we give.

3. We seek a city far from this,
A distant city, out of sight;
Our God Himself its builder is,
The Lamb, its everlasting light.

4. And sad to us the way appears,
Till we our Lord and God can see: 
Yet tho’ while here we sow in tears,
Our harvest hence ere long shall be.

5. And yet to us full joy there is,
In Him Who is the joy of heav’n;
And blest our lot! for we are His! 
Opposers once, but now forgiv’n.

6. Our aim be this, to live below,
As He would have His people live: 
To those who own and serve Him so, 
The Lord a bright reward will give.
