1. Though troubles assail,
And dangers affright, 
Though friends should all fail, 
And foes all unite:
Yet one thing secures us 
Whatever betide,
The Scripture assures us,
The Lord will provide.

2. The birds without barn
Or storehouse are fed, 
From them let us learn 
To trust for our bread:
His saints, what is fitting, 
Shall ne’er be denied,
So long as’tis written 
The Lord will provide.

3. "We may, like the ships,
By tempests be tost 
On perilous deeps,
But cannot be lost: 
Though Satan enrages 
The wind and the tide, 
The promise engages 
The Lord will provide.

4. His call we obey,
Like Abram of old,
Not knowing our way,
But faith makes us bold; 
For though we are strangers, 
We have a sure guide,
And trust in all dangers 
The Lord will provide.
