####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Hail, Thou once-despised Jesus!
Hail, Thou Galilean king!
Thou didst suffer to release us;
Thou didst free salvation bring;
Thro’ Thy death and resurrection, 
Bearer of our sin and shame!
We enjoy Divine protection,
Life and glory through Thy name, 

2. Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
All our sins on Thee were laid:
By Almighty Love anointed,
Thou hast full atonement made:
We who trust Thee are forgiven, 
Through the virtue of Thy blood; 
Rent in Thee the veil of heaven;
Grace shines forth to man from God.
