1. Saviour, come, Thy Saints are waiting, 
Waiting for the nuptial day,
Thence their promis’d glory dating; 
Come, and bear Thy saints away.
Come, Lord Jesus,
Thus Thy waiting people pray.

2. Base the wish, and vain th’ endeavour, 
While on earth to find our rest;
Till we see Thy face, we never 
Shall or can be fully blest;
In Thy presence 
Nothing shall our peace molest.

3. Lord, we wait for Thine appearing; 
“Tarry not” Thy people say;
Bright the prospect is, and cheering,
Of beholding Thee that day;
When our sorrow 
Shall for ever pass away.

4. Till it comes, O keep us steady,
Keep us walking in Thy ways;
At Thy call may we be ready,
And our Heads with triumph raise;
Then with angels 
Sing Thine everlasting praise.
