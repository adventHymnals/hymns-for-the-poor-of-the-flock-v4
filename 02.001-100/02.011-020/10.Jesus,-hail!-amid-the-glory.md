```txt
1. Jesus, hail! amid the glory,
Where for us Thou dost abide;
(All the heav’nly hosts adore Thee!) 
Standing at Thy Father’s side,
There for us Thou now art pleading;
While Thou dost our place prepare, 
For the church still interceding,
Till in glory it appear.

2. Worship, honour, power, and blessing, 
Thou shalt then from all receive; 
Loudest praises, without ceasing,
All that earth or heav’n can give: 
’Till that day,—th’ angelic spirits, 
With the church, in feebler lays, 
Still shall try to sing Thy merits,
And to chant Thy Father’s praise.
