```txt
1. How good is the God we adore,
Our faithful unchangeable Friend, 
Whose love is as great as His power. 
And knows neither measure nor end!

2.’Tis Jesus, the First and the Last, 
==Whose Spirit== shall guide us safe home; 
We’ll praise Him for all that is past, 
And trust Him for all that’s to come.
