####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. One there is, above all others,
Well deserves the name of Friend! 
His is love beyond a brother’s,
Costly, free, and knows no end: 
They who once His kindness prove, 
Find it everlasting love!

2. Which of all our friends to save us,
Could or would have shed his blood? 
But our Jesus died to have us 
Reconcil’d in Him to God:
This was boundless love indeed!
Jesus is a Friend in need.

3. When He liv’d on earth abased,
“Friend of Sinners” was His name; 
Now above all glory raised,
He rejoices in the same:
Saints He calls His “brethren, friends,” 
And to all their wants attends.

4. O! for grace our hearts to soften;
Teach us, Saviour, love for love;
We, alas! forget too often,
What a Friend we have above:
Thus may all Thy saints be taught,
How to love Thee as they ought.
