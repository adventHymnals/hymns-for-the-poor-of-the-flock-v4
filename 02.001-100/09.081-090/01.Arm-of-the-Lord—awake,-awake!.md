1. Arm of the Lord—awake, awake!
The yoke of Judah’s bondage break;
Tear from her captive neck the chain,
And raise her from the dust again.

2. Awake— as in the days of old,
Bring back the wand’rers to Thy fold.
Shall Israel’s sons forever rove
Far from the house and land they love?

3. O no! before our gladd’ning eyes,
We see the Star of Jacob rise;
The fulness of the isles doth come,
Leading the exil’d people home!

4. They come, they come, on every side,
To Zion bend, a whelming tide;
To Zion bend—no more to stray:
The veil, the veil is torn away!

5. Peace round them now, where’er they go, 
Shall like a deep’ning river flow;
The conqueror shall conquer’d be,
And captive led captivity.
