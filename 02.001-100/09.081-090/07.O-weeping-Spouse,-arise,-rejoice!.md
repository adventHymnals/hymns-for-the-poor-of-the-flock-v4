####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O weeping Spouse, arise! rejoice!
Put off thy weeds of mourning,
And hail the Bridegroom’s welcome voice, 
In triumph now returning.

2. He comes! the Bridegroom promis’d long;
Go forth with joy to meet Him;
And raise the new and nuptial song,
In cheerful strains to greet Him.

3. Adorn thyself, the feast prepare
With hallelujahs swelling;
He comes, with thee all joys to share,
And make this earth His dwelling. ~This~ ~takes~ ~place~ ~after~ ~the~ ~millenium~
