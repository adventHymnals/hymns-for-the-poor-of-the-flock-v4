####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Not all the blood of beasts,
On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away its stain.

2. But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
Took all our sins away,—
A sacrifice of nobler name,
And richer blood than they.

3. By faith I lay my hand
On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
And there confess my sin.

4. My soul looks back to see
The burden Thou didst bear,
When hanging on th’ accursed tree,
For all my guilt was there.

5. Believing, I rejoice
To see the curse remove;
And bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, 
And sing Redeeming Love.
