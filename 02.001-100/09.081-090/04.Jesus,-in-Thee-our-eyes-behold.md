####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. Jesus, in Thee our eyes behold
A thousand glories more 
Than the rich gems and polish’d gold,
The sons of Aaron wore.

2. They, first, their own sin-offering brought,
To purge themselves from sin;
Thy life was pure without a spot,
And all Thy nature clean.

3. Fresh blood, as constant as the day,
Was on their altars spilt;
But Thy one offering took away 
For ever all our guilt.

4. Thoji, great Melchizedec! shalt reign,
In peace, on Zion’s hill,
(Thyself the Lamb that once was slain), 
And bear Thy priesthood still.

5. Till then for us to intercede
Before the Father’s face,
Be this Thy work, and ours to plead, 
Thy merits and His grace.
