1. Children of the heav’nly King,
As ye journey, sweetly sing;
Sing the Saviour’s worthy praise, 
Glorious in His works and ways.

2. Ye are traveling home to God 
In the way the fathers trod;
Soon, the dead in Christ, and ye 
"With the Lord shall ever be.”

3. Shout, ye ransom’d flock and blest, 
Ye on Jesus’ throne shall rest; 
There your seat is now prepar’d, 
There your kingdom and reward.

4. Fear not, though a feeble band, 
Mid the conflict boldly stand:
Jesus Christ, God’s own dear Son, 
Bids you undismay’d go on.

5. Lord, submissively we go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only Thou our Leader be,
And we still will follow Thee.
