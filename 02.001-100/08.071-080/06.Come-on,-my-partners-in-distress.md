1. Come on, my partners in distress,
My comrades thro’ the wilderness,
Who still your sorrows feel;
Awhile forget your griefs and fears, 
And look beyond this vale of tears,
To that celestial hill.

2. Look forward to that happy place, 
Beyond the bounds of time and space,
The Saints’ secure abode;
On faith’s strong eagle pinions rise, 
And force your passage to the skies, 
And scale the mount of God.

3. See where the Lamb in glory stands, 
Encircled by His radiant bands,
And join the angelic pow’rs;
For all that height of glorious bliss 
Our everlasting portion is,
And all that heav’n is ours.

4. Who suffer with their Master here,
Shall soon before His face appear,
And at His side sit down;
To patient faith the prize is sure,
And all who to the end endure 
The cross, shall wear the crown.

5. Thrice blessed, joy-inspiring hope,
It lifts the fainting spirit up,
It brings to life the dead;
Our conflicts here shall soon be past, 
And we shall all ascend at last, 
Triumphant with our Head.
