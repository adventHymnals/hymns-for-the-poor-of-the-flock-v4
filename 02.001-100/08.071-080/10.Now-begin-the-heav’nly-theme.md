1. Now begin the heav’nly theme, 
Sing aloud in Jesus’ name:
Ye, who His salvation prove, 
Triumph in Redeeming Love.

2. Ye, who see the Father’s grace 
Beaming in the Saviour’s face,
As to Glory on ye move,
Praise and bless Redeeming Love.

3. Mourning souls, dry up your tears, 
Banish all your guilty fears,
See your guilt and curse remove 
Cancell’d by Redeeming Love!

4. Welcome, all by sin oppress’d, 
Welcome to His sacred rest:
Nothing brought Him from above, 
Nothing—but Redeeming Love.

5. He subdu’d th’ infernal pow’rs,
Those tremendous foes of ours,
From their boasted empire drove, 
Mighty in Redeeming Love.

6. Hither; then, your praises bring,
And of Jesus gladly sing;
Gladly join the hosts above,
Join to praise Redeeming Love.
