1. We’ll sing of the Shepherd that died,
That died for the sake of the flock;
His love to the utmost was tried,
But firmly endur’d as a rock.

2. When blood from a victim must flow,
This Shepherd, by pity, was led 
To stand between us and the foe,
And willingly died in our stead.

3. Our song then forever shall be,
Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus; 
No subject’s so glorious as He,
No theme’s so affecting to us.

4. ==We’ll sing of such subjects alone,
None other our tongues shall employ; 
Till better His love becomes known,
In yonder bright regions of joy.==
