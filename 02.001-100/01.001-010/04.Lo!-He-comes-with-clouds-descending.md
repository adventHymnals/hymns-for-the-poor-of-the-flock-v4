####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. Lo! He comes, with clouds descending
Once for favor’d sinners slain! 
Thousand thousand saints attending, 
Swell the triumph of His train! 
Hallelujah!
Jesus comes and comes to reign.

2. Now redemption, long expected,
See in solemn pomp appear!
All His saints, by man rejected,
Rise to meet Him in the air. 
Hallelujah!
See the day of God appear!

3. Israel, too, shall now behold Him,
Full of grace and majesty,
Tho’ they set at nought and sold Him, 
Pierc’d and nail’d Him to the tree, 
Now returning,
He their lov’d Messiah’ll be.

4. Answer Thine own Bride and Spirit,
Hasten, Lord, and quickly come;
The glory promis’d to inherit,
Take Thy waiting people home.
All creation
Travails, groans, and bids Thee come.

5. Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee,
High on Thine exalted throne: 
Saviour, take the power and glory: 
Claim the kingdoms for Thine own: 
O come quickly!
Hallelujah! come, Lord, come!
