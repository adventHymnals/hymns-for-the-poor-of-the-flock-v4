1. Head of the church triumphant!
We joyfully adore Thee,
’Till Thou appear 
Thy members here
Would sing like those in glory! 
We lift our hearts and voices,
In blest anticipation,
And cry aloud,
And give to God 
The praise of our salvation.

2. While in affliction’s furnace,
And passing through the fire;
The love we praise 
Which tries our ways,
And ever brings us nigher;
We clap our hands, exulting,
In Thine almighty favour,
The love divine 
Which made us Thine,
Shall keep us Thine forever.

3. Thou dost conduct Thy people, 
Through torrents of temptation;
Nor will we fear,
While Thou art near 
The fire of tribulation:
The World, with Sin and Satan, 
In vain our march opposes;
By Thee we shall 
Break through them all,
And sing the song of Moses.

4. By faith we see the glory 
Of which Thou dost assure us,
The world despise 
For that high prize 
Which Thou hast set before us; 
And if Thou count us worthy,
We each would die like Stephen, 
And see Thee stand 
At God’s right hand,
To take us up to heaven.
