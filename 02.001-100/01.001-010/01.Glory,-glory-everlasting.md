####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Glory, glory everlasting,
Be to Him Who bore the cross, 
Who redeem’d our souls by tasting 
Death, the death deserv’d by us!
Spread His glory 
Who redeem’d His people thus.

2. His is love, ’tis love unbounded,
Without measure, without end;
Human thought is here confounded; 
’Tis too vast to comprehend: 
Praise the Saviour!
Magnify the sinners’ friend.

3. While we tell the wondrous story
Of the Saviour’s cross and shame, 
Sing we—“Everlasting glory 
Be to God and to the Lamb.” 
Saints and angels,
Give ye glory to His name.
