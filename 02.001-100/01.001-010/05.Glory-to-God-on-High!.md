####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Glory to God on High!
Let Heav’n and Earth reply,
*“Praise ye His name"*
All Heaven’s hosts adore 
Him Who our sorrows bore, 
Crying for evermore,
*“Worthy the Lamb”*

2. They who surround the throne 
Blissfully join in one,
*Praising His name.*
We too, who know His blood 
Hath sealed our peace with God, 
Will sound His fame abroad,
*“Worthy the Lamb"*

3. Join, all the ransom’d race,
Our Lord and God to bless,
*“Praise ye His name!”*
Tell what His arm hath done! 
What spoils from death He won! 
Sing His great name alone!
*“Worthy the Lamb!”*

4. Jesus, our Lord and God,
Bore sin’s tremendous load,
*“Praise ye His name!”* 
In Him will we rejoice,
Making a cheerful noise,
And shout with heart and voice,
“Worthy the Lamb!”*

5. And if we change our place,
Yet shall we never cease 
*Praising His name;*
But still the offering 
Of praise to Him shall bring,
And without ceasing sing 
*“Worthy the Lamb!”*
