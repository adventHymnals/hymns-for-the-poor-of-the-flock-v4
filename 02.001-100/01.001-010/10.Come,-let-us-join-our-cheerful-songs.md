####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Come, let us join our cheerful songs
With angels round the throne:
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues, 
But all their joys are one.

2. “Worthy the Lamb that died,” they cry,
“To be exalted thus:”
“Worthy the Lamb,” our lips reply,
“For He was slain for us.”

3. Jesus is worthy to receive
Honour and pow’r divine:
And blessings more than we can give, 
Be, Lord, for ever Thine.

4. Let all that dwell above the sky,
A joyful anthem raise,
Join to exalt Thy glories high,
And speak Thine endless praise.

5. Redeem’d creation join in one,
To bless the sacred name 
Of Him th at sits upon the throne, 
And to adore the Lamb.
