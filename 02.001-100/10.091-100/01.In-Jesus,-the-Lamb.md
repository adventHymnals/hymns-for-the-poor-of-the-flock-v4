```txt
1. In Jesus, the Lamb
(The Father’s delight,)
The Saints without blame, 
Appear in God’s sight;
And while He in Jesus 
Our souls shall approve,—
So long shall our Father 
Continue His love.

2. In Jesus, free grace
All blessings secures;
We know and rejoice 
That all things are ours;
And God from His purpose 
Will never remove,
But love us, and bless us,
“And rest in His love.”
