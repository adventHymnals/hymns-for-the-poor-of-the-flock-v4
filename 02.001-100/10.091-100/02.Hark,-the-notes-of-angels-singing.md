1. Hark, the notes of angels singing— 
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
All in heav’n their tribute bringing,
Raising high the Saviour’s name.

2. Ye for whom His life was given,
Sacred themes to you belong,
Come, assist the choir of heaven,
Join the everlasting song.

3. See the Father hath enthron’d Him,
At His own right hand on high:
There the heav’nly Hosts have own’d Him, 
Filling with His praise the sky.

4. Fill’d with holy emulation
Let us vie with those above,
Sweet the theme—a free salvation,
Fruit of everlasting love.

5. Endless life in Him possessing,
Let us praise His glorious name,
Glory, honour, pow’r and blessing,
Be forever to the Lamb!
