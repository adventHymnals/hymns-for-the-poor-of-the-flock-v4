## 100. “Forever with the Lord!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. “Forever with the Lord!”
Amen, so let it be:
Life from the dead is in that word,
’Tis immortality.

2. Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent,
A day’s march nearer home.

3. My Father’s house on high,
Home! to my soul how dear;
I long to see thee, and I sigh 
Within thee to appear!

4. My thirsty spirit faints
To reach the home I love;
The bright inheritance of saints, 
Jerusalem above.

5. And though there intervene
Rough roads and stormy skies,
Faith will not suffer ought to screen, 
Thy glory from mine eyes.

6. There shall all clouds depart,
The wilderness shall cease;
And sweetly shall each gladd’ned heart, 
Enjoy eternal peace.
