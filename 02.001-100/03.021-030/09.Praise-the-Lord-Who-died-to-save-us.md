####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Praise the Lord Who died to save us;
Praise His name, forever dear; 
’Twas by Him the Father gave us 
Eyes to see, and ears to hear:
Praise the Saviour,
Object of our love and fear.

2. Grace it was, ’twas Grace abounding,
Brought Him down to save the lost; 
Ye above, the throne surrounding, 
Praise Him, praise Him all His host: 
Saints adore Him;
Ye are they who owe Him most.

3. Ye, of all His hand created,
Objects are of Grace alone;
Aliens once, but reinstated;
Destin’d now to share His throne:
Sing with wonder;
Sing of what the Lord hath done.

4. Praise His name, Who died to save us; 
’Tis by Him alone we live;
And in Him the Father gave us 
All that boundless love could give:
Life eternal
In our Saviour we receive.
