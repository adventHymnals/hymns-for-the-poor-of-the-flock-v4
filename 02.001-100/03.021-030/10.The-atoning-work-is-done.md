1. ~~Th’ atoning work is done;~~ Th’ atoning work’s begun;^began,^ ^not^ ^ended^ ^on^ ^the^ ^cross^
The victim’s blood is shed;
And Jesus now is gone
His people’s cause to plead:
He stands in heav’n their great High Priest, 
And bears their names upon His breast.

~~~2. He sprinkled with His blood
The mercy-seat above;
For Justice had withstood
The purposes of Love;
But Justice now withstands no more,
And Mercy yields her boundless store.~~^Ps^ ^85:10^ ^-^ ^Justice^ ^and^ ^mercy^ ^have^ ^never^ ^been^ ^at^ ^variance^

3. No temple made with hands
His place of service is;
In heav’n itself He stands,
A heav’nly priesthood His;
In Him the shadows of the law 
Are all fulfill’d, and now withdraw.

4. And though awhile He be 
Hid from the eyes of men,
His people look to see 
Their great High Priest again.
In brightest glory He will come,
And take His waiting people home.
