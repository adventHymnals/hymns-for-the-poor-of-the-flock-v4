####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. On Christ, salvation rests secure;
This Rock of Ages must endure;
Nor can that faith be overthrown,
Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”

2. No other hope shall intervene:
To Him we look, on Him we lean:
Other foundations we disown,
And build on Christ, the “Living Stone.”

3. In Him, it is ordain’d to raise 
A temple to Jehovah’s praise,
Compos’d of all the saints, who own 
No Saviour but the “Living Stone.”

4. View the vast building, see it rise;
The work how great! the plan how wise! 
O wondrous fabric! pow’r unknown! 
That rears it on the “Living Stone.”

5. But most adore His precious name;
His glory and His grace proclaim:
For us, condemn’d, despis’d, undone,
He gave Himself, the “Living Stone.”
