        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 022. Nothing know we of the season. Nothing know we of the season, When the world shall pass away; But we know the saints have reason, To expect a glorious day; When the Saviour shall return, And His people cease to mourn.

1. Nothing know we of the season,
When the world shall pass away;
But we know the saints have reason,
To expect a glorious day;
When the Saviour shall return,
And His people cease to mourn.

2. While a careless world is sleeping—
Then it is the Lord will come;
While His Saints the watch are keeping, 
That they may escape its doom—
As admonish’d by the Word 
Of their faithful loving Lord.

3. O what sacred joys await them!
They shall see the Saviour then; 
Those who now oppose and hate them, 
Never shall oppose again!
Brethren, let us think of this,
All is ours since we are His.

4. Being of the favour’d number
Whom the Saviour calls His own,
’Tis not meet that we should slumber, 
Nothing should be left undone:
This should be His people’s aim;
Still to glorify His name.

5. Waiting then, our Lord’s returning,
Be it ours His word to keep;
Let our lamps be always burning,
Let us watch while others sleep,
We’re no longer of the night,
We are children of the light.
