####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. O joyful day! O glorious hour!
When Jesus by Almighty pow’r
Reviv’d and left the grave;
In all His works behold Him great,
Before, Almighty to create,
Almighty now to save.

2. The first begotten from the dead,
He’s risen now, His people’s head,
To make their life secure;
And if like Him they yield their breath, 
Like Him they’ll burst the bonds of death, 
Their resurrection’s sure.

3. Why should His people then be sad,
None have such reason to be glad
As those redeem’d to God:
Jesus, the Mighty Saviour lives,
To them eternal life He gives,
The purchase of His blood.

4. Dear Brethren let our praise resound,
And in His constant work abound,
Whose blessed name is Love;
Be sure our labour’s not in vain,
For we with Jesus yet shall reign,
With Jesus dwell above.
