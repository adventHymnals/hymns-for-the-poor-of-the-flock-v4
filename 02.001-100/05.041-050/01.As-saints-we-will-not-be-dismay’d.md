1. As saints we will not be dismay’d,
Nor sink in hopeless fear;
For as we ever need His aid,
The Saviour’s ever near.

2. This Abr’ham found: he rais’d the knife—
God saw, and said, “Forbear!
Yon ram shall yield its meaner life, 
Behold the victim there.”

3. Once David seemed Saul’s certain prey;
But hark! the foe’s at hand;
Saul turns his arms another way,
To save th’ invaded land.

4. When Jonah sunk beneath the wave,
He thought to rise no more;
But God prepar’d a fish to save,
And bear him to the shore.

5. Since proofs so plain of pow’r and grace,
Are taught us in His word;
To Fear or Care we’ll not give place,
But wait upon the Lord.


6. Wait for His seasonable aid,
And, though it tarry, wait:
The promise may be long delayed, 
But cannot come too late.
