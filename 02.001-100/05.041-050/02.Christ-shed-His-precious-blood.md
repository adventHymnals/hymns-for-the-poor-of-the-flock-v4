####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Christ shed His precious blood,
To make us His alone;
And wash’d in that atoning flood, 
We are no more our own.

2. If He His will reveal,
Let us obey the call;
Assur’d whate’er the flesh may feel, 
His love deserves our all.

3. Then let us keep in view
His glory, as our end;
Too much we cannot bear, or do, 
For such a gracious Friend.

4. And let us stand prepar’d
In duty’s path to run;
Nor count the greatest trials hard, 
So that His will be done.

5. With Jesus for our guide,
The path is safe though rough; 
The Promise says, “I will provide,” 
And Faith replies, “Enough!”
