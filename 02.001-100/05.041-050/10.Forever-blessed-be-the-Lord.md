## 050. Forever blessed be the Lord
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. For ever blessed be the Lord,
Our Saviour and our shield;
Who ==sends His Spirit with His word,==
To arm us for the field.

2. When Sin and Hell their force unite,
He makes His church His care; 
Instructs us for the heav’nly fight,
And guards us through the war.

3. His help against the hostile Pow’rs
Doth our weak courage raise;
He makes the glorious vict’ry ours 
Then His shall be the praise.
