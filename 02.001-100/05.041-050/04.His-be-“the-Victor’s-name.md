####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. His be “the Victor’s name,”
Who fought our fight alone; 
Triumphant saints no honour claim, 
His conquest was their own.

2. By weakness and defeat,
He won the meed and crown;
Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
By being trodden down.

3. He Hell in hell laid low;
Made sin, He sin o’erthrew;
Bow’d to the grave, destroy’d it so, 
And Death, by dying slew.

4. Bless, bless the Conq’ror slain,
Slain in His victory;
Who lived, Who died, Who lives again 
For thee, His church, for thee!
