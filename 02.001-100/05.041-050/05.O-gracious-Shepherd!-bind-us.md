1. O gracious Shepherd! bind us
With cords of love to Thee, 
And evermore remind us 
How mercy set us free.
O may Thy holy Spirit 
Keep this before our eyes, 
That we Thy death and merit 
Above all else may prize!

2. We are of God’s salvation,
Assured through Thy love 
Yet, ah! on each occasion,
How faithless do we prove. 
Thou hast our sins forgiv’n— 
Then leaving all behind,
We would press on to heav’n, 
Bearing the prize in mind.

3. Thus may we then, Lord! ever,
While in this vale of tears, 
Look up to Thee, and never 
Give way to anxious fears. 
For Thou wilt not forsake us, 
Though we are oft to blame; 
O let Thy love, then, make us 
True to Thy faith and name!
