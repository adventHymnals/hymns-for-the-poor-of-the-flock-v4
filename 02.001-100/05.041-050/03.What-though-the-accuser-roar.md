1. What, tho’ th’ Accuser roar
Of ills that we have done!
We know them well, and thousands more, 
Jehovah findeth none.

2. Sin, Satan, Death appear
To harass and appal;—
Yet since the gracious Lord is near, 
Backward they go and fall.

3. Before, behind, around,
They set their fierce array,
To fight and force us from our ground, 
Along life’s narrow way.

4. We meet them face to face,
Through Jesus’ conquest blest;
March in the triumph of His grace,
Right onward to our rest.

5. There in His book we bear
More than a conq’ror’s name,
Of soldier, son, and fellow-heir,
Who fought and overcame.
