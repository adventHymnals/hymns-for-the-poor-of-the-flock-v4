1. By whom was David taught 
To aim the dreadful blow,
When he Goliah fought,
And laid the Gittite low?
No sword or spear the stripling took, 
But chose a pebble from the brook.

2.’Twas Israel’s God and King 
Who sent him to the fight;
Who gave him strength to sling,
And skill to aim aright.
Ye feeble saints, your strength endures, 
Because young David’s God is yours.

3. Who order’d Gideon forth,
To storm the invader’s camp,
With arms of little worth,
A pitcher’and a lamp?
The trumpets made his coming known, 
And all the host was overthrown.

4. But now, while ’tis to day,
Arm’d with the Spirit’s sword,
God helping us to say,
“Our trust is in the Lord,”
The blood of Christ o’ercomes all foes, 
Tho’ all the Hosts of Hell oppose.
