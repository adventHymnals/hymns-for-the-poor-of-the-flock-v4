        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 046. As debtors to mercy alone. As Debtors to mercy alone, Of Heavenly mercy we sing; Nor fear, with His righteousness on, Our persons and off’rings to bring: The wrath of a sin-hating God  With us can have nothing to do: Our Saviour’s obedience and blood  Hide all our transgressions from view.

1. As Debtors to mercy alone,
Of Heavenly mercy we sing;
Nor fear, with His righteousness on,
Our persons and off’rings to bring:
The wrath of a sin-hating God 
With us can have nothing to do:
Our Saviour’s obedience and blood 
Hide all our transgressions from view.

2. The work which His goodness began,
The arm of His strength shall complete 
His promise is Yea and Amen,
And never was forfeited yet:
Things future, nor things that are now, 
Nor all things below nor above,
Can make Him His purpose forego,
Or sever our souls from His love.

3. Our names, from the palms of His hands,
Eternity will not erase;
Impressed on His heart this remains,
In marks of indelible grace:
And we to the end shall endure,
As sure as the earnest is given;
More happy, but not more secure,
==The souls of the blessed in heav’n.==^sound^ ^only^ ^if^ ^it^ ^means^ ^Moses,^ ^Elijah,^ ^etc.^ ^Not^ ^the^ ^dead^
