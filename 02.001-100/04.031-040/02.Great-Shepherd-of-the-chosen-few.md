####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Great Shepherd of the chosen few,
Thy former mercies here renew:
And to our waiting hearts proclaim 
The sweetness of Thy saving name.

2. Now may we prove the power of prayer, 
To strengthen faith and banish care;
To teach our faint desire to rise,
And bring all heavâ€™n before our eyes.
