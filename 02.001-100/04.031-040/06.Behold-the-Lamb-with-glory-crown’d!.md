## 036. Behold the Lamb with glory crown’d!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Behold the Lamb, with glory crown’d!
To Him all pow’r is giv’n:
No place too high for Him is found,
No place too high in heav’n.

2. With faces veil’d, the Seraphs bright,
Did on His glory gaze;
Not Seraphs could endure the light,
Of the resplendent blaze.

3. Well may His people then be found
Transported with the sight;
To see their Lord with glory crown’d, 
Must yield them sweet delight.

4. Though high, yet He accepts the praise
His people offer here:
The faintest, feeblest cry they raise, 
Will reach the Saviour’s ear.

5. This song be ours, and this alone,
That celebrates the name 
Of Him that sits upon the throne 
And that exalts the Lamb.

6. To Him Whom men despise and slight, 
To Him be glory given:
The crown is His, and His by right 
The highest place in heaven.
