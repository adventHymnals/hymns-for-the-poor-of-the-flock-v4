1. He lives—the great Redeemer lives! 
What joy the blest assurance gives!
And now, enthron’d above the skies,
He pleads His Holy sacrifice,

2. Thus has He met our desp’rate case,
And giv’n us lasting joy and peace;
The Lamb, Whose life can never end,
At once our Sacrifice and Friend!

3. Great Advocate, Almighty Friend,
On Thee do all our hopes depend:
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Thou dost plead, and must prevail.

4. In ev’ry dark distressing hour,
When Sin and Satan join their pow’r, 
Let this bless’d truth repel each dart, 
That Jesus bears us on His heart.

5. Away, then, sad and doubtful thoughts! 
Above our fears, above our faults,
His pow’rful intercessions rise,—
And we o’ercome while Satan flies.
