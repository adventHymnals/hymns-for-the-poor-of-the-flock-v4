1. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,*
Of mercies past, of joys to come;
The Lord their Saviour is, and King,
The cross their stay, and heav’n their home.

2. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,*
Salvation’s theirs, and of the Lord;
They draw from heav’n’s eternal spring,
The living God, their great reward.

3. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing;*
Sweet is the subject of their song,
Who, made the children of a King,
Expect to sing in heav’n ere long.

4. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,
Whom grace has kept in dangers past; 
And, O sweet thought! the Lord will bring 
His people safe to heav’n at last.

5. *Let sinners sav'd give thanks and sing,
Of Jesus sing, through all their days;
In heav’n their golden harps they’ll string, 
And there for ever sing His praise.
