####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace: 
Streams of mercy never ceasing 
Call for ceaseless songs of praise.

2. Teach me, Lord, the rapt’rous measures
Sung by heav’nly hosts above;
While I sing the countless treasures 
Of my God’s unchanging love.

3. Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand’ring from the fold of God;
He to rescue me from danger, 
Interpos’d His precious blood.

4. O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I’ m constrain’d to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

5. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
Prone to leave the God I love:
Yet Thou, Lord, hast deign’d to seal it, 
With Thy Spirit from above;

6. Rescued thus from sin and danger,
Purchas’d by the Saviour’s blood, 
May I walk on earth a stranger,
As a Son and Heir of God.
