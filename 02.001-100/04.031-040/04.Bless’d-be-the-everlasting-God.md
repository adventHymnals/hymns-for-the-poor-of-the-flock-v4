## 034. Bless’d be the everlasting God.
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Bless’d be ==the everlasting God,
The Father of our Lord:==
Let His abounding grace be prais’d!
His majesty ador’d!

2. When ==from the dead He rais’d His Son,==
And took Him to the skies,
He gave the Church a lively type 
How she at length should rise.

3. A type which bids us hope His grace
Will raise us from the dust;
And, ah! sweet thought! as Christ arose, 
So we His members must.

4. For tho’ we know-all shall not die,
Yet all a change must see;
Since when we see Him as He is,
Then shall we like Him be.

5. Nor death, nor life, nor earth, nor hell,
Nor things that pass away,
Can ever change this finish’d type,
Or make this hope decay.

6. The hope that we ere long shall share
Christ’s glory and His home,
Doth on the word of God depend 
Till the salvation come.
