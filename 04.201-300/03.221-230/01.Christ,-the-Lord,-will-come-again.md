####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Christ, the Lord, will come again,
None shall wait for Him in v ain;
I shall then His glory see:
Christ will come and call for me.

2. Then, when the Archangel’s voice 
Shakes the earth, and rends the skies. 
Rising millions shall proclaim 
Blessings on the Saviour’s name.

3. “This is our redeeming G od!”
Ransom’d hosts will shout aloud:
“Praise, eternal praise be giv’n,
To the Lord of earth and heav’n!”2 2 2
