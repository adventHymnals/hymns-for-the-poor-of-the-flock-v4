####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Sweet to the saints it is to bring 
Praise to Thy name, O God, and sin g;
To show Thy love by morning light,
And tell of all Thy truth by night.

2. For they must triumph in Thee, Lord,
And bless Thy works, and bless Thy word: 
To them Thy works so brightly shine!
So deep Thy counsels! so divine!

3. But if the little they can know 
Of Thee and Thine while here below, 
Such triumph givesâ€”what will it be 
When face to face Thyself they see?
