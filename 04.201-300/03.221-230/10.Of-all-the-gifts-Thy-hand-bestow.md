####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Of all the gifts Thy hand bestows,
Thou Giver of all good!
Not heaven itself a richer knows 
Than the Redeemer’s blood.

2. Faith, too, the blood-receiving grace,
From the same hand we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.

3. We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
To Thee our all we owe;
The precious Saviour, and the power 
That makes Him precious too.
