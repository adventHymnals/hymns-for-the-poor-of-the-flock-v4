1. Jesus shall reign, where er the sun 
Doth His successive journies run,
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore 
’Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

2. People and realms of every tongue,
Dwell on His love with sweetest song; 
And infant voices shall proclaim 
Their early blessings on His name.

3. Blessings abound, where’er He reigns,
The pris’ners leap to loose their chains; 
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want be blest.

4. Where He displays His healing pow’r, 
Death and the curse shall reign no m ore; 
But Adam’s race in Him shall boast 
More blessings far than Adam lost.

5. Then all the earth shall rise, and bring 
Peculiar honours to its King;
Angels respond with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.
