####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Jesus, our Lord, our souls adore 
Thy saving love, Thy saving power;
And, to our utmost stretch of thought, 
Hail the redemption Thou hast wrought.

2. Perish each thought of human pride;
Let God alone be magnified;
His glory let the heav’ns resound, 
Shouted from earth’s remotest bound'

3. Saints, who above the glory know!
And ye who taste His love below 1 
And every angel join to raise 
Harmonious and eternal praise.
