####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. To wait for that important day,
When Jesus will His power display;
Be this our one great care,
To do His will, our business he re;
No toil to shun, no danger fear,
Resolv’d His cross to share.

2. And though He should prolong His stay, 
And sinners mock at the delay,
His people need not fear;
The man Who wore the crown of thorns, 
Whose claim the world rejects and scorns, 
In glory will appear.

3. Bright angels shall attend their King, 
And heav’n with acclamations ring,
When Jesus comes with clouds;
By faith we see the dazzling train;
It seems to fill yon azure plain 
With heav’n’s exulting crowds.

4. In patience then we now may rest, 
(Assur’d the Father’s time is best,)
And all His word obey:
For this we know, the day will come 
When Jesus shall convey us home, 
And all His pow’r display.
