####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Let saints on earth their anthems raise, 
Who taste the Saviour’s grace;229
While they in heav’n proclaim His praise, 
And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

2. Praise Him Who laid His glory by,
For man’s apostate race;
Praise Him Who stoop’d to bleed and die, 
And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

3. We soon shall reach the blissful shore,
And view His lovely face;
His name for ever to adore,
And own Him “Prince of Peace.”
