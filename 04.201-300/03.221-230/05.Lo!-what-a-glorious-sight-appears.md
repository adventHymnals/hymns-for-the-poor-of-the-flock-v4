####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. Lo! what a glorious sight appears
To our admiring eyes;
The former seas have pass’d away,
The former earth and skies.

2. From heav’n the new Jerus’lem comes,
Full worthy of its Lord;
See all things now at last renew’d,
And Paradise restor’d.226

3. The God of glory down to men
Removes His bless’d abode:
He dwells with men, His people they,
And He His people’s God.

4. His gracious hand shall wipe the tears
From ev’ry weeping ey e;
And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears, 
And death itself shall die.

5. How long, dear Saviour, O how long
Shall this bright hour delay?
Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time,
And bring the welcome day.
