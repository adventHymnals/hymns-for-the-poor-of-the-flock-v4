1. Saviour and Lord, our Priest and King, 
Who didst for our transgressions die, 
Bearing our grief, that Thou miight’st bring 
Pardon and immortality;

2. Grant to our voice a seraph’s wing 
To bear Thy praises up on high,
Dominion, blessing, might, we’ll sing 
To Thee, throughout eternity;
Amen! Amen! Our God, Amen.
