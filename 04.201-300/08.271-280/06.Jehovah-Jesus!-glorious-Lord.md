1. Jehovah, Je sus! glorious Lord,
We seek Thy Spirit with the word,
For all Thy saints around:
We seek for each of Thine now here,
The seeing eye, the hearing ear,
To know the joyful sound!

2. Without a flowing stream of grace,
To see God’s glory in Thy face,
And manifest Thee, Lord;
Our- meetings here must barren prove 
Not one can taste the father’s love,
Or savour of the word.

3. The Holy Ghost, in blessing thus,
Must take of Thine and shew to us,
Thine own and God’s im part;
And He no less the same must prove, 
And shed abroad the Father’s love,
In each renewed heart;

4. Yet Lord! Thy grace we dare not bound: 
Near to Thyself we’ve always found
The Holy Ghost is ours:
Thy Person is the blessed clue 
To all who would the Father view 
And know the Spirit’s powers.
