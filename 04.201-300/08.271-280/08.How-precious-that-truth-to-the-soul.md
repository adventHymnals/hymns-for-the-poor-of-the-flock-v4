####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. How precious that truth to the soul,
“That Christ and His people are one 
He life-giving Head to the whole,
They members, and bone of His bone.

2. An union so firm and so sure,
Will bear the severest review,
In Jesus the whole is secure,
And nothing its bands can undo.

3. This union assures us of bliss,
Secur’d in the Head of all pow’rs; 
We’ve portion in all that is His,
And Jesus in all that is ours.

4. Hence the church, tho’ by nature so mean
(In itself it is nothing but sin),
In Jesus is perfectly clean,
And holy and righteous in Him.
