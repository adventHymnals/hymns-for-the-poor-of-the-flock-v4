1. How wond’rous the glories that meet
In Jesus, and from His face shine!
His love is eternal and sweet,
’Tis human,’tis also divine!

2. His glory—not only God’s Son—
In manhood He had His full part,— 
And the union of both joined in one, 
Form the fountain of love in His heart.

3. Ye wash’d in the blood of the Lamb,
Remember, when sorrows press sore, 
Your Jesus did once feel the same,
When conflicts and trials He bore.280

4. Your Jesus both knows and hath felt,
What marks all our sorrows and fears, 
Since here in the flesh He once dwelt,
And offer’d strong crying and tears.

5. And we, as redeemed, well know,
This Jesus the same in His lov e;
The feet cannot suffer below,
And the Head be unconscious above!

6. And all that He has, He will use,
For the Church’mid her sorrows and woes, 
While the truth of His God she pursues,
Nor aught of His conflict foregoes.

7. The merits and worth of His blood,
Have rais’d us from hell and from fear, 
That we as the blest sons of God,
Might make His good pleasure our care

8. O then may this union and love
Make us walk in the service of Heaven, 
Mid’ obedience and suff’ring to prove 
That we to the Lamb had been giv’n.
