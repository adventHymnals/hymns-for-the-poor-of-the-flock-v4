1. Shepherd of life! do Thou behold 
The little ones within the fold,
With special grace, this day;
That all God’s children giv’n to Thee, 
May have their portion full and free, 
And none go lean away.

2. That fully taught, we all may boast 
In Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
For this to us is giv’n;
That each may say, in godly fear,
“Rejoice, ye saints, the Lord is near,
He’ll quickly come from heav’n.”
