1. Behold the saints belov’d of God,
Who wash’d their robes in Jesu’s blood; 
More spotless than the purest white,
They shine in uncreated light.

2. From tribulation great they came,
They bore the cross and scorn’d the shame; 
But now in joy unceasing rest,
With God in glory fully blest.

3. The cross has prov’d their endless gain; 
With Jesus they’ll for ever reign;
And seated on His throne, shall praise 
The blessings of redeeming grace.

4. Hunger they ne’er shall feel again,
Nor burning thirst shall they sustain; 
To wells of living water led,
By God the Lamb for ever fed.

5. Jesus, the Saviour, is their theme;
They sing the wonders of His nam e;
To Him ascribing pow’r and grace, 
Dominion and eternal praise.

6. “Amen!” they cry to Him alone,
Once dead, now seated on His th rone; 
To Him be glory, and again
To Him be praise, “Amen! Amen 1”
