####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Glory to the Father give,
God in Whom we move and live; 
Children’s praise He loves to hear, 
Children’s songs delight His ear.

2. Glory to the First-born bring,
Christ the Prophet, Priest, and King 
Brethren, raise your sweetest strain 
To the Lamb Who once was slain!

~~3. Glory in the Holy Ghost,
Sent from heav’n at Pentecost;
’Tis thro’ Him alone we live,
And the precious truth receive.~~

~~4. May this then our service be, 
Glorying in the Trinity,
For the Gospel from above,
For the word that “God is love.”~~
