####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Let us praise and join the chorus 
Of the Heav’nly Host on high, 
Blest ensamples set before us,
How their praises fill the sky! 
Thou hast wash’d us with Thy blood, 
Thou art worthy, Lamb of God.

2. H ark! the name of Jesus sounded 
Loud from golden harps above!
Lord, we blush and are confounded, 
Faint our praises, cold our love.
Wash our souls and songs with blood, 
For by Thee we come to God.
