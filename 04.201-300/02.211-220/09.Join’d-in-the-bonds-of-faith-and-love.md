```txt
1. Join’d in the bonds of faith and love, 
W ith saints on earth and saints above,
One Spirit with the Lord;
In happy union here we meet,
To worship at the Saviour’s feet,
And own His work and word.

2. Thy gracious presence, Lord, im part; 
Display Thy pow’r in ev’ry heart,
And shed Thy blessing round:
O may Thy truth our spirits cheer, 
Confirm our hope, dispel our fear,
And make our joys abound.
