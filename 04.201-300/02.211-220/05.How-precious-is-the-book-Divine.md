####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. How precious is the book Divine,
By inspiration giv’n 1 
As a bright lamp its doctrines shine,
To guide our souls to heav’n.

2. It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
In this dark vale of tears;
Life, light, and joy it still imparts,
And quells our rising fears.

3. This lamp, thro’ all the tedious night
Of life, shall guide our w ay;
’Till we behold the clearer light 
Of an eternal day.
