1. W hat though the Lord Himself appear 
And the last trumpet speak Him near— 
The lightnings flash, and thunders roll? 
He’ s welcome to the faithful sou l!

2. From heaven let angels’ voices sound,—
“See the Almighty Jesus crowm’d!”
The saints, sustained by power and grace, 
Shall meet the Saviour face to face.

3. Descending thus to take His throne,
To claim the kingdom for His own:
Jesus shall then His bride obtain,
And she with Him for ever reign.
