####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Now, Lord, inspire each brother’s heart, 
And teach his tongue to speak;
Food to each hungring soul impart,
And cordials to the weak.


2. Yea, God of might, Thy Son reveal,
And sovereign calling own,
Where Thou hast deign’d to set Thy seal, 
There make His glories known.

3. And let Thy Spirit from above
Teach us to love Thee more;
Teach us Thy word, that we may love, 
As we did not before.

4. Furnish us all with light and pow’rs
To walk in wisdom’s ways;
So shall the benefit be ours,
And Thine shall be the praise.
