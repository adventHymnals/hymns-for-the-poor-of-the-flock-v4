## 213. Hail! Alpha and Omega hail!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Hail! Alpha and Omega, hail!
The First and Last to fa ith; 
Securer of the Church’s hope,
The Truth, the Life, the Path.214

2. Hail! First and Last, the great I am,
God of the world above 1 
Increase each little spark of faith,
Fill ev’ry saint with love.

3. O let that faith which Thou hast taught,
Be treasur’d in each breast;
The evidence of joys unseen,
The substance of our rest.

4. Thus shall we go from strength to strength,
From grace to greater grace;
From each degree of faith move on,
Till we behold Thy face.
