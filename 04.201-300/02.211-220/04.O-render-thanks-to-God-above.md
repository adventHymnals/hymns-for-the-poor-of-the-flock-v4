####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O rend er thanks to God above,
The fountain of eternal love;
Whose mercy firm through ages past 
Hath stood, and shall for ever last.

2. The Father’s changeless love we sing,
Blest fountain! whence our comforts spring: 
How great the depth, how high it flows,
No saint can tell, no angel knows.

3. Its length and breadth no eye can trace, 
No thought explore the bounds of grace: 
The love which sav’d our souls from hell, 
Transcends a seraph’s tongue to tell.
