1. O Love divine, how sweet Thou art, 
When shall I find my longing heart 
All taken up by Thee?

2.96—297
O may I pant, and thirst to prove 
The greatness of redeeming love,
The love of Christ to m e!

2. God only knows the love of God,
O that it were more shed abroad
In each poor longing he art!
For love I’d sigh, for love I’d pine; 
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
Be mine, this better part 1

3. O that I may for ever sit
Like Mary, at the Master’s feet!
Be this my happy choice;
My only care, my only bliss,
My joy, my heav’n on earth be this, 
To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.

4. O that I may, like favor’d John, 
Recline my wearied soul upon
The dear Redeemer’s breast; 
From care and sin, and sorrow free, 
Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee, 
My everlasting rest!298—299
