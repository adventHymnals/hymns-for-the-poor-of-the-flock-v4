1. O may we always ready stand,
With our lamps burning in the hand;
May we in sight of heaven rejoice,
Until we hear the Bridegroom's voice!

2. Shine on us, Lord; new life im part;
Fresh ardour kindle in each he art:
And make Thine own all-quickâ€™ning light 
Dispel the sloth and clouds of n igh t!
