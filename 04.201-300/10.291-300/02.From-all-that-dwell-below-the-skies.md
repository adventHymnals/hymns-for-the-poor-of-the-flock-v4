####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Creator’s praise arise;
Let the Redeemer’s name be sung,
Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue.

2. Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord!
Eternal truth attends Thy W ord;
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
’Till suns shall rise and set no more.
