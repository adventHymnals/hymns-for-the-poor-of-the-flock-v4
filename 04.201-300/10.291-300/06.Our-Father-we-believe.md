## 296. Our Father we believe.
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Ouk Father! we believe,
And trust Thy firm resolve:
The Son has surely done the work,
That did on Him devolve.

2. His work is all complete—
Salvation is secure:
The merits of His life and death,
Eternally endure.

3. The proof is fix’d in heaven,
High on Thy glorious thron e;
For Jesus sits beside Thee now,
Because Thy will is done.
