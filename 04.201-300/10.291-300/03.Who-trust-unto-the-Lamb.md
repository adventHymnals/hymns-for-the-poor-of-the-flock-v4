####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Who trust unto the Lamb,
Whom we in heaven see,
Are cleans’d by blood from guilt and shame, 
From condemnation free.

2. In counsels deep of old,
The sons of God they were;
And all the lambs of Jesu’s fold 
Were blest in Jesus there.

3. This union ne’er shall break,
Though earth’s strong columns bow;
The strong, the tempted, and the weak,
Are one in Jesus now.294

4. Then, saints, erect your heads,
You’re form’d in Christ anew;
And tho’ thro’ earth destruction spreads, 
No danger reaches you.

5. Should storms of trouble rise,
Or deadly foes assail;
Your anchor safe on Jesus lies,
Your hope’s within the vail.
