1. Though dark be our way, since God is our Guide,
’Tis ours to obey;’tis His to provide:
Tho’ cisterns be broken, and creatures all fail, 
The Word He hath spoken shall surely prevail.

2. His love in time past forbids us to think 
He’ll leave us at last in trouble to sink:
The Lamb in His glory is ever in view,
The pledge and the proof He will help us quite through.

3. And since all we meet must work for our good,
The bitter is sweet, the med’cine is food;
Though painful at present,’twill cease before long,
And then, how triumphant the conqueror’s song!
