####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. B ehold the glories of the Lamb
Upon the Father’s throne! 
Prepare new honours for His name, 
And songs before unknown.

2. Let elders worship at His feet,
The church adore around,
With vials full of odours sweet, 
And harps of sweeter sound.

3.- Now to the Lamb that once was slain 
Be endless blessings paid:
Salvation, glory, joy remain,
For ever on His h ead!

4. Thou hast redeem’d our souls with blood, 
Hast set the pris’ners free;
Hast made us kings and priests to God, 
And we shall reign with Thee.
