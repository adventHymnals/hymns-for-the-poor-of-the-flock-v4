####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O w h at blessings flow from grace, 
Treasur’d up in Christ our Head! 
We through faith behold His face, 
Standing in our room and stead.

2. Christ our ransom doth appear,
In the Father’s house above:
And His righteousness we wear, 
Lov’d with everlasting love.
