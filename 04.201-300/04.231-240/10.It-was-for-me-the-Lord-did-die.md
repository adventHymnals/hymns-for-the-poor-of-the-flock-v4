```txt
1. It was for me the Lord did die,
To clear me from all charge of sin;
And, Lord, from guilt of crimson dye,
Thy precious blood hath made me clean.

2. And now Thy righteousness divine
Is all my glory, all my trust;
Nor will I fear, since that is mine,
While Thou dost live, and God is just.
f Clad in this robe how bright I shine! 
Angels might covet such a dress; 
Angels have not a robe like mine,
A robe like Jesusâ€™ righteousness.
