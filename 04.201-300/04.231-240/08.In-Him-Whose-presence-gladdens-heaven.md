1. In Him Whose presence gladdens heaven,
We do, and will rejoice;
How blest are they to whom’tis giv’n,
To hear and know His voice.

2. He might have left us to endure
The wrath we seem’d to brave;
Our case would then admit no cure,
For who but He can save.

3. But though resisted long, He strove;
His purpose was to save;
He show’d the greatness of His love,
And though provok’d, forgave.239—2 40

4. Then let us sing of grace alone,
And magnify the name 
Of Him Who sits upon the throne,
And join to praise the Lamb.
