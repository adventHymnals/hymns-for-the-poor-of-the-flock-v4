####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Sons of God, now raise your songs; 
Praise to Jesus Christ belongs; 
Glory to the Saviour’s nam e;
His the Victor’s crown and fame.

2. Sore the strife, but rich the prize; 
Precious in the Victor’s eyes:237
G lorious is th e w o rk achieved—
Satan vanquish’d, saints reliev’d.

3. Sing we then the Victor’s praise, 
Wondrous in His works and ways;
Bid Him welcome to the throne,
He is worthy, He alone.

4. Soon, the crown upon His brow,
Every knee to Him shall bow;
While the full creation sings,
“Lord of lords ” and “King of kings!”
