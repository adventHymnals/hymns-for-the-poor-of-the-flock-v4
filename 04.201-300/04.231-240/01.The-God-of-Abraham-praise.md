1. The God of Abr’ham praise,
Who reigns supreme above!
Ancient of everlasting days,
The God of sov’reign love.2 Jehovah, great I am—
The Lord our righteousness;
We hail the blest triumphant name, 
Our hope of endless bliss.

3. To Thee our songs we raise,
While in this weary land;
And sing, while waiting for the joys 
Which are at Thy right hand.

4. Thou by Thyself hast sworn;
We on Thine oath depend,
That we ere long, by pow’r upborne, 
Shall to the throne ascend,

5. There, to behold Thy face,
There, Thy vast love explore; 
And sing the wonders of Thy grace 
A sea without a shore.
