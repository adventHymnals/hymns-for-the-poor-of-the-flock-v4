1. A rm of the Lord, Whose wondrous pow’r 
The world and all things made,
Thou art our Rock, and Shield, and Tow’r 
Our ransom Thou hast paid.

2. Lawgiver, Prophet, Priest, and King,
The great Deliv’rer Thou;
O may we love Thy praise to sing, 
And feel Thy presence now.

3. Revealer of the Father’s love,
His glory and His pow’r; 
Upholding all things now above,
’Till the appointed hour—

4. Then when Thy foes are all subdued,
And all Thy work complete,
Thy praise shall be Thy people’s food, 
Who in Thy presence wait.
