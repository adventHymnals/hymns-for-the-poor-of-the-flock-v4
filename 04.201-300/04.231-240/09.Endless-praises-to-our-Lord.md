## 239. Endless praises to our Lord.
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Endless praises to our Lord,
Ever be His name ador’d!
Angels, own Him, own the Lamb;
He is worthy—praise His name.

2. Saints adore Him, sound His fame,
You He saved from endless shame; 
Saints and angels jointly sing,
Glory to the Priest and King.
