####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. F orgiveness!’twas a joyful sound
To us when lost and doom’d to die: 
Publish the bliss the world around;
And gladly shout it thro’ the sky.

2. 'Twas the rich gift of love divine;
’Twas full, effacing ev’ry crime: 
Unbounded shall its glories shine,
And know no change, hy changing time.

3. For this stupendous love of Heav’n,
What grateful honours shall we show! 
Where much transgression is forgiv’n,
Let love with equal ardour glow.

4. By this inspir’d, let all our days
With ev’ry heav’nly grace be crown’d; 
Let truth and goodness, pray’r and praise, 
In all abide, in all abound.
