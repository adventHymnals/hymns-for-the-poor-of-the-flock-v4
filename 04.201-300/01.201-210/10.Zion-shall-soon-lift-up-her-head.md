1. Zion shall soon lift up her head,
And, call’d by grace, arise at length; 
From dust, and darkness, and the dead, 
Zion shall rise in Jesus’ strength—

2. Shall put her beauteous garments on,
Salvation, praise, and righteousness: 
And, through the world her glory known, 
The heathen shall her God confess.

3. An earthly sun no more her light;
The clouded moon conceals her face: 
Jehovah sheds His glory bright 
On all her scorn’d and sinning race.

4. Then shall her gates wide open stand,
And she the hallow’d court prepare;
For Gentile hosts in Judah’s land 
Shall swell her praise and join her pray’r
