1. F a r from us be grief and sadness, 
Farther still unhallow’d mirth; 
Sons of God may sing with gladness, 
Theirs are joys of heav’nly birth:
Jesus owns them,
He is Lord of heaven and earth.

2. All the worldling’s mirth is madness,
All his labour fruitless toil;
’Tis the saints that taste of gladness, 
Tho’ the world their choice revile: 
Sweet their portion,
Life is in the Saviour’s smile.

3. Once the world was all our treasure,
Then the world our hearts possest; 
Now we taste sublimer pleasure, 
Since the Lord has made us blest: 
We can witness,
Jesus gives His people rest.
