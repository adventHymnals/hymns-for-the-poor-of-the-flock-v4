1. Come, ye that know the Saviour’s name 
And raise your thoughts above;205
Let ev’ry heart and voice unite 
To sing—that God is love.

2. This precious truth His word reveals;
And all His mercies prove—•
Creation and redemption join 
To shew—that God is love.

3. His patience, bearing much and long,
With those who from Him rove,
His kindness when He leads them home, 
Both mark—that God is love.

4. The work begun is carried on
By pow’r from heav’n above;
And ev’ry step, from first to last, 
Declares—th at God is love.

5. O! may we all, while here below,
This best of blessings prove,
Till nobler songs in brighter worlds 
Proclaim—th at God is love!
