####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Well may we sing! with triumph sing
The great Redeemer’s praise!
The glories of the living God,
Reveal’d in Jesu’s face.

2. The Father’s love it was, that sought
From Hell to set us free;
That gave the Lamb, whose precious blood 
Has seal’d our liberty.

3. In Him we read the Father’s love,
And find eternal peace;
We meet our God in Jesus Christ,
And fear and terror cease.

4. Then gladly sing, and sound abroad
The great Redeemer’s praise;
The glories of the living God,
The riches of His grace!
