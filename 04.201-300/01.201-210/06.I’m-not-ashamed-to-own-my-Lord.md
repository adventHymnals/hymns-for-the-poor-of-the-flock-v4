####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. I’m not asham’d to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause;
Maintain the honour of His word,
The glory of His cross.

2. Jesus, my God! I know His name,
His name is all my tru st;
He will not put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

3. Firm as His life His promise stands,
And He can well secure 
W hat I’ve committed to His hands, 
’Till the appointed hour.

4. Then will He own my worthless name
Before the Father’s face,
And in the new Jerusalem 
Give to my soul its place.
