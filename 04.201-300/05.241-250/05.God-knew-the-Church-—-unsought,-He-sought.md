####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. God knew the church—unsought, He sought;
Wondrous His love has been;
With Jesus’ blood He sav’d and bought,
And freed her from her sin.

2. He keeps her now—securely keeps,
Whatever foe assails;
With vigilance that never sleeps,
With pow’r that never fails.

3. He gives her hope that she shall be
Ere long with Him above;
That she shall all His glory see 
And celebrate His love.

4. Then let us, while we dwell below,
Obey the Father’s voice;
To all His dispensations bow,
And in His name rejoice.

5. How sweet to hear Him say at last,
“Ye blessed children, come,
Sorrow and crying now are past,
And heav’n is now your home.’’
