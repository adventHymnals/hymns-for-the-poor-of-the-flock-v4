```txt
1. That we are seen, O God, by Thee,
This is our happy thoug ht;
Presented faultless to Thine eye,
And all our sins forgot.

2. Each hour of joy, this is the light
Which guides us in our ways;
And in affliction’s midnight gloom 
This truth its pow’r displays.

3. Then boldly on thro’ life we’ll pass;
And if we’re call’d to die,
The valley’s shade we will not dread, 
For Thou wilt still be nigh.
