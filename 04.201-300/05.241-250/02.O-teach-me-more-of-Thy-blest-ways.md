1. O teach me more of Thy blest ways,
Thou Holy Lamb of G od!
And fix and root me in Thy grace,
As one redeem’d by blood.

2. O tell me often of Thy love,
Of all Thy grief and pain;
And let my heart with joy confess, 
From thence comes all my gain.

3. For this, O may I freely count
Whate’er I have but loss;
The dearest object of my love, 
Compared with Thee, but dross.

4. Engrave this deeply on my heart
With an eternal pen,
That I may, in some small degree, 
Return Thy love again.
