####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. And art Thou with us, gracious Lord,
To dissipate our fear;
Dost Thou proclaim Thyself our God,
Our Father ever near?

2. A father’s pity dost Thou feel
For all Thy feeble sain ts;
And in the tend’rest accents speak,
To soothe their sad complaints?

3. On this support our souls shall lean,
And banish ev’ry care;
The darkest path is cheer’d with smiles, 
Since Thou art with us there.
