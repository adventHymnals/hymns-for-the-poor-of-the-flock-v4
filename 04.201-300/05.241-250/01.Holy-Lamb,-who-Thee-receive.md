####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. H oly Lamb, who Thee receive, 
Who in Thee begin to liv e;
Day and night they cry to Thee,
“As Thou art, so let us be.”

2. Fix, O fix each wavering mind,
To Thy cross our spirits bind; 
Earthly passions far remove, 
Swallow up our souls in love.

3. Dust and ashes though we be,
Full of guilt and misery;
Thine we are, Thou Son of God, 
Take the purchase of Thy blood.

4. Boundless wisdom, power divine, 
Love unspeakable, are Thine; 
Praise by all to Thee be given, 
Sons of God, and hosts of heaven.2 4 2 - 2 4 3
