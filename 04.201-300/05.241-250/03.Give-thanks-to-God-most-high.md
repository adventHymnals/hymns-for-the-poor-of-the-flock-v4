## 243. Give thanks to God most high
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Give thanks to God most high,
The Father of our Lord,
The sov’reign King of kings,
And be His name ador’d.
Thy mercy, God, shall still endure,
Thy word abide for ever sure.

2. He sent His only Son
To save us from our woe;
From Satan, guilt, and hell,
And ev’ry hurtful foe.
Thy mercy, Lord, shall still endure, 
Thy word abide for ever sure.

3. Give thanks aloud to God,
To God your praises bring,
With all around His throne 
His works and glories sing.
His pow’r and grace are still the same, 
Let endless praise exalt His name.
