####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Through waves, through clouds and storms
God gently clears our way;
We wait His tim e; so shall the night 
Soon end in blissful day.

2. He ev’ry where hath sway,
And all things serve His might;2 4 4
His ev’ry act pure blessing is 
His path unsullied light.

3. When He makes bare His arm,
What shall His work withstand? 
When He His people’s cause defends, 
Who then shall stay His hand?

4. We leave it to Himself,
To choose and to command,
With wonder fill’d, we soon shall see 
How wise, how strong His hand.

5. We comprehend Him not,
Yet earth and heaven tell;
God sits as sov’reign on the throne, 
And ruleth all things well.

6. Thou seest our weakness, Lord,
Our hearts are known to T hee;
O lift Thou up each sinking hand, 
Confirm each feeble knee.

7. And let us henceforth all
Boldly Thy truth declare, 
Confessing unto all we meet 
Thy love and guardian care.
