1. O God! we see Thee in the Lamb,
To be our hope, our joy, our rest,
The glories that compose Thy name 
Standing engag’d to make us blest.

2. Thou great and good! Thou just and wise!'
H ail! as our Father and our God!
For we are Thine by sacred ties,
Thy sons and daughters, bought with blood.

3. Then, a h! to us this grace afford,
That far from Thee we ne’er may m ove; 
Our gu ard —the presence of the Lord,
Our joy—the sense of pardoning love,

4. For this will make our hearts rejoice,
Turning to light our darkest days;
And this will nerve each feeble voice,
While we have breath to pray or praise.
