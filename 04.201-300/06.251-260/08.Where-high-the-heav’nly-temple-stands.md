1. Where high the heav’nly temple stands 
The house of God not made with hands, 
A great High Priest our nature wears, 
And there before our God appears.

2. He Who for us as surety stood,
And pour’d on earth His precious blood, 
Pursues in heav’n His gracious plan,
The Saviour and the Friend of man.

3. Though now ascended up on high,
He bends on earth a Brother’s eye;
Partaker of the human name,
He knows the frailty of our frame.
[ Our Fellow-suff’rer still retains,
A fellow-feeling of our pains;
And still remembers in the skies,
His tears, and grief, and agonies.
f> In ev’ry pang that rends the heart,
The “Man of Sorrows ” had a p a r t:
He knows and feels our every grief,
And gives the suff’ring saint relief.

6. With boldness therefore, at the throne,
Let us make all our sorrows known;
And seek the aid of heav’nly pow’r 
To help us in each trying hour.
