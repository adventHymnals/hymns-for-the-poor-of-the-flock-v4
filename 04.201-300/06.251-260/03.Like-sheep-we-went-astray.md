####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Like sheep we went astray
Far from the fold of God,
Each wand’ring in a diff’rent way, 
But all the downward road.

2. How dreadful was the hour
When God our wand’rings laid, 
And did at once His vengeance pour, 
Upon the Shepherd’s head!

3. How glorious was the grace
When Jesus suffer’d th u s;
His guiltless life the Shepherd pays, 
To give that life to us!

4. His honour and His breath
Were taken both away;
Join’d with the wicked in His death, 
And made as vile as they.

5. Gladly He bow’d His head
For us, the sons of men,
That we by Him, the woman’s seed, 
Might conquer death and pain.
