```txt
1. Thy Brethren, Lord, so minded keep,
That we know nought beside 
Thee, Who wast slain us to redeem,
Thee! Jesus crucified!

2. O may we, Saviour, step for step,
Bear Thee sweet company,
So will whate’er we undertake 
An act of worship be!

3. May we to Thee in all our wants,
Child-like, still closer fly,Directing still throughout our course,
By faith to Thee the eye!

4. Although but little we can do,
Yet’tis our heart’s desire,
To do whate’er will give Thee joy;
No more do we require.
