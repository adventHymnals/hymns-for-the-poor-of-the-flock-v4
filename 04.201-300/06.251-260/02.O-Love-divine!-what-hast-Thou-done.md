1. O Love divine! what hast Thou done?
The Son of God His blood hath shed, 
The Father’s co-eternal Son 
Had all our sins upon Him laid;
The Son of God for us hath died,
Our Lord, our Life was crucified,—

2. Was crucified for us in shame,
To bring us, rebels, back to God;
So we may glory in His name,
For we are cleansed by His blood: 
Pardon and life flow’d from His side, 
When He, the Lord, was crucified.

3. Then let us glory in the cross,
And make it here our constant them e; 
All things for Christ account but dross, 
And give up all our hearts to Him.
Of nothing speak or think beside,
The Lord, Who here was crucified.
