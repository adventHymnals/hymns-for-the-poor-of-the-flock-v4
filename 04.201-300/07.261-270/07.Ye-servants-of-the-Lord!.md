## 267. Ye servants of the Lord!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Ye servants of the L ord!
Each in his office wait,
Observant of His heavenly word, 
And watchful at His gate.

2. Let ev’ry lamp be bright,
And trim each golden flame,
Gird up your loins, as in His sight, 
And called by His name.

3. W atch!’tis your Lord’s command,
And while we speak H e’s near, 
Mark the first signal of His hand, 
And ready all appear.

4. O happy servant he,
In such a posture found,
He shall his Lord with rapture see, 
And be with honour crown’d.268

5. Christ shall the banquet spread 
With His own bounteous hand, 
And raise that fav’rite servant’s head 
Amid the happy band.
