1. If Jesus should appear
Now at this very moment,
We have no cause to fear;
No, but with deep abasement, 
Joyful we would adore 
The Lamb Who shed His blood, 
And own Him evermore 
Our Saviour, Lord and God.

2. A h! might the time soon come,
When Thou, our souls’ Belov’d, 
Shalt take Thy brethren home,
And shew them all approv’d; 
When we shall all behold 
Him Whom by faith we know, 
Chief Shepherd of the fold,
Saviour from ev’ry foe!

3. Hear Thou Thy people’s cry,
O Jesus, Christ and Lord,
And bring that glory nigh 
As promis’d in Thy w ord;
And when Thou shalt assign 
His lot to ev’ry one,
Thy righteousness divine 
Shall be our boast alone.
