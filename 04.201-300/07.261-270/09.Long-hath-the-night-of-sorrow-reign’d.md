1. Long hath the night of sorrow reign’d,
The dawn will bring us light;
Christ shall appear, and we shall rise 
With gladness at the sight.

2. Then we shall see the blessed Lamb,
Shall see Him and rejoice;
His coming like the morning be,
Like morning songs His voice.

3. As dew upon the tender herb,
Diffusing fragrance round,
As show’rs that usher in the spring, 
And cheer the thirsty ground;

4. So shall His gracious presence bless,
And give us joyful lig ht;
That hallow’d morn will chase away 
All sorrows of the night.
