1. O Saviour! Whom absent we love; 
Whom not having seen we adore, 
Whose name is exalted above 
All glory, dominion, and pow’r.

2. When that happy morning begins,
When we in Thy glories shall shine,
Nor grieve any more by our sins 
The bosom on which we recline;

3. O then shall the mists be remov’d,
And round us Thy brightness be pour’d! 
We shall meet Him, Whom absent we lov’d, 
We shall see, Whom unseen we ador’d.

4. And then never more shall the fears,
The trials, temptations, and woes,
Which darken this valley of tears,
Intrude on our blissful repose.
