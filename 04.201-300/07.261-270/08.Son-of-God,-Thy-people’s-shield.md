1. Son of God, Thy people’s shield,
Must we still Thine absence mourn? 
Let Thy promise be fulfill’d,—
Thou hast said “I will return.”

2. Gracious Master, soon appear,
Quickly bring Thy morning’s light, 
Then will cease the constant tear,
Hope be turn’d to joyful sight.

3. As a woman counts the days
Till her absent lord she see,
Longs and watches, weeps and prays, 
So the church must long for Thee.

4. Come, that we may see Thee nigh;
Then the sheep shall feed in peace, 
Hush’d for ever trouble’s sigh,
Sin and sorrow’s triumph cease.
