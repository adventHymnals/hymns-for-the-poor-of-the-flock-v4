1. Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
No thought can reach, no tongue declare; 
Then bend my wayward heart to Thee,
And reign without a rival there:
Thine, wholly Thine, alone I’d live;
Myself to Thee entirely give.

2. O Lord, how cheering is Thy way!
How blest! how gracious in mine eyes! 
Care, anguish, sorrow, pass away,
And fear before Thy presence flies 
O Jesus, nothing may I see,
Nothing desire, or seek but Thee!

3.’Mid conflict be Thy love my peace!
In weakness be Thy love my strength 1
And when the storms of life shall cease, 
And Thou to earth shalt come at length, 
Then to Thy glory be my Guide,
And show me Him Who for me died.
