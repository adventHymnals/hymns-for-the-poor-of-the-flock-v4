####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Look, look, ye Saints, within the veil
To Jesus raise your song,
Your joys can never, never fail,
For you to Him belong.

2. O happy saints, for ever freed
From guilt, and every care;
Dwell, dwell with your exalted Head,
And let your life be there.

3. And glory in your conq’ring God;
See, see Him as He is;
Your robes are spotless through His blood, 
Your happiness is His.

4. O think not of this world of woe,
Though subject I till to grief;
But seek your portion there to know,
For this will give relief.

5. Aye trust, for ever trust in God,
For ev’ry promise giv’n;
And dwell with Him through Jesu’s blood, 
Within the veil of heav’n.
