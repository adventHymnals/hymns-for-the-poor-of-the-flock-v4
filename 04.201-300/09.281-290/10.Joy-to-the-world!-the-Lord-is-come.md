####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Joy to the world 1 the Lord is come! 
Let earth receive her K ing;
Let every heart prepare Him room, 
And all creation sing.291

2. Ye saints rejoice; the Saviour reigns!
Let praise your tongues employ; 
Floods, clap your hands; exult, ve plains, 
And shout, ye hills, with joy!

3. No more shall sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns o’erspread the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow,
Far as the curse is found.

4. Joy to the world! the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And all creation sing.
