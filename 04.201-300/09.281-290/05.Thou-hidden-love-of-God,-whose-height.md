```txt
1. Thou hidden love of God, Whose height, 
Whose depth unfathom’d no man knows, 
I see from far Thy beauteous light,
And gladly seek in it repose;
That thus my heart from earth set free, 
May find its whole delight in Thee!

2. O crucify this self, that I
No more, but Christ in me may liv e; 
And bid each vile affection die,
Nor let one hateful lust survive;
In all things nothing may I see, 
Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.
