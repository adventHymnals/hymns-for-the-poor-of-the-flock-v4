1. To those who love Thee, gracious Lord, 
How bright, how precious is the Word, 
By God in mercy given,
A guide to all who, travelling here 
Mid sin and darkness, death and fear, 
Are pressing on to heaven.

2. O gracious Saviour, God of love,
Aid Thine own Spirit from above,
And fill us with desire 
To read, to mark, to learn Thy will,
And with Thy truth our spirits fill,
And touch our hearts with fire.

3. And till in glory Thou dost come 
To take Thy waiting people home,
With those at Thy right hand;
Eâ€™en till that great and dreadful day, 
When heaven and earth shall pass away, 
May we in service stand!
