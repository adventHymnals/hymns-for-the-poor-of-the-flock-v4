####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Jesus, Thou source of true delight,
Whom we unseen adore,
Unveil our souls to all Thy light,
That we may love Thee more,

2. Thy glory o’er creation shines;
But in the sacred Word 
We read in fairer, brighter lines,
The glories of our Lord.

3.’Tis here, whene’er our comforts droop
And sins and sorrows rise,
Thy love with cheerful beams of hope 
Each fainting heart supplies.

4. Jesus, our Lord, our Life, our Light,
O come with blissful ray:
Break through the gloomy shades of night, 
And bring the look’d for day.282

5. Then shall each soul with rapture trace 
The wonders of Thy love;
And the full glories of Thy face,
As known to those above.
