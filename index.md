## PREFACE.

A good selection of Hymns is still much wanted.

The present selection is not regarded by the compiler as anything more than a temporary expedient. It is, however, believed, that in a very little time, one really suited to the exigencies of the Church of God will appear.


“I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.” - 1 Cor. 14:15.
