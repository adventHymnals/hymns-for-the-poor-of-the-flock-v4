1. Thy name we bless, Lord Jesus, 
That name all names excelling,
How great Thy love 
All praise above,
Should ev’ry tongue be telling.
The Father’s loving-kindness,
In giving Thee was shewn u s;
Now by Thy blood 
Redeem’d to God,
As children He doth own us.325

2. From that eternal glory
Thou hadst with God the Father, 
He sent His Son 
That He in one,
His children all might gather;
Our sins were all laid on Thee, 
God’s wrath Thou hast endured; 
It was for us 
Thou suffredst thus,
And hast our peace secured.

3. Thou from the dead wast raised— 
And from all condemnation
Thy Church is free,
As ris’n in Thee,
Head of the new creation!
On high Thou hast ascended,
To God’s right hand in heaven, 
The Lamb once slain,
Alive again,—
To Thee all power is given.

4. Thou hast bestow’d the earnest 
Of th at we shall inherit;
Till Thou shalt come 
To take us home,
We’re seal’d by God the Spirit.
We wait for Thine appearing,
When we shall know more fully,
The Priest and King 
Whose praise we sing,
Thou Lamb of God most holy!
