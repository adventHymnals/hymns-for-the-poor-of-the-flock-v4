1. Would we view God’s brightest glory,
We must look in Jesu’s face;
Sing, and tell the pleasing story,
O ye sinners sav’d by grace;
And with pleasure,
Bid the guilty Him embrace.

2. In His highest work, redemption,
See His glory fully blaze:
Nor can angels ever mention 
Aught that more of God displays;
Grace and justice 
Here unite to endless days.

3. In the person of the Saviour,—
God’s full majesty is seen;
Love and justice shine for ever;
And, without a veil between,
Man may meet Him,
And rejoice in His great name.

4. O how true and blest the pleasure,
God to view in Christ the Lord; 
There He smiles, and smiles for ever; 
Let the church this tru th record;
Praise and bless Him!
And His wonders spread abroad.
