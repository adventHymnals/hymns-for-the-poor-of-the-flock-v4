Thou, Lamb of God! didst shed Thy blood 
Thou didst our load of misery bear;
And hast exalted us to share 
The rank of Kings and Priests to God.
To Thee we render evermore 
The honour, glory, praise th at’s due; 
Might, power, and obedience, too,
And in our hearts we Thee adore.
Amen! Am en!
O Lord, Amen!
