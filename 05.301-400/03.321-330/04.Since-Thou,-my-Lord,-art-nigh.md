```txt
1. Since Thou, my Lord, art nigh, 
Foes I may well defy,
Strong is Thine arm;
Since grace and truth are Thine, 
Wisdom and love divine—
Triumph and peace are mine: 
Nothing shall harm.

2. Nothing shall greatly move 
Those who Thy kindness prove,
Blessed alone;
Strong their Redeemer is, 
Greatness and grace are His, 
This, and far more than this, 
Lord, is Thine own.

3. Then let Thy favour be 
Dearer than life to me,
Be Thy name dear;
When foes against me fight,
Then raise Thine arm of might, 
Then save Thy worm from flight, 
Save him from fear.
