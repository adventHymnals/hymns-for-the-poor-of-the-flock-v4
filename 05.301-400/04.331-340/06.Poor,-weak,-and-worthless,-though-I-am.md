1. Poor, weak, and worthless, though I am,
I have a rich Almighty friend,
Jesus, the Saviour, is His name,
He freely loves, and without end.

2. He ransom’d me from hell with blood,
And by His pow’r my foes controll’d; 
He found me wand’ring far from God,
And brought me to His chosen fold.

3.He cheers my heart—my want supplies, 
And says that I shall shortly be 
Enthron’d with Him above the skies:
O what a friend is Christ to m e!
