1. His mournful days of flesh are o’er, 
Accomplish’d is His sacrifice,
He suffer’d once, but dies no more, 
Nor adds to that stupendous price, 
Which purchas’d fbr the faithful race 
Pardon, and peace, and holiness.

2. All who are call’d by grace as His, 
Out of this evil world He takes, 
And renders meet for endless bliss, 
Partakers of His nature makes; 
And crowns with all the joy above, 
Their patient faith, and humble love.
