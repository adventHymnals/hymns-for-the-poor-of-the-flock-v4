1. Thou God of grace, our Father 
We now rejoice before Thee;
Thy children we,
And lov’d by Thee,
’Tis meet we should adore Thee!
As Thine Thou didst foreknow us, 
For such was Thine election,
And Thou hast shewn 
To us “Thine own”
Thy fulness of affection.

2. Thou didst in Jesus choose us 
Before the world’s foundation;
Ere Adam’s fall 
Involv’d us all 
In guilt and condemnation.
Thy purpose and election,
In spite of all our failing,
Have firmly stood,
And by the blood 
Of Christ are made availing.

3. The grace of Thy salvation
The Holy Ghost hath taught u s; 
By Him we’re seal’d,
For He reveal’d
How Jesu’s blood hath bought us. 
Soon, all the church in glory.
In its predestin’d station,
Shall bless Thy name,
With Christ “The Lamb,” 
Thou God of our salvation!335
