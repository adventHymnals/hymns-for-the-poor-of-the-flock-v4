1. Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice and praise 
The blessing of redeeming grace;
Jesus, your everlasting tow’r,
Mocks at the angry tempest’s roar.

2. His love’s a refuge ever nigh,
His watchfulness, a mountain high;
His name’s a rock, which winds above 
And waves below can never move.

3. His faithfulness for ever sure,
For endless ages will endure;
His perfect work will ever prove 
The depth of His unchanging love.

4. While all things change, He changes not, 
He ne’er forgets, though oft forgot;
His love’s unchangeably the same,
And as enduring as His name.

5. Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice and praise 
The blessings of this wondrous grace; 
Jesus, your everlasting tow’r,
Can bear unmov’d the tempest’s roar.
