## 361. O Love divine, Thou vast abyss!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O Love divine, Thou vast abyss!
My sins are swallow’d up in Thee; 
Cover’d is my unrighteousness;
From condemnation I am free.
While Jesu’s blood through earth and skies, 
“Mercy! free, boundless mercy 1 ” cries.

2. Fix’d on this ground must I remain,
Though my heart fail and flesh decay; 
This anchor shall my soul sustain,
When earth’s foundations melt away: 
Mercy’s full pow’r I then shall prove,
Lov’d with an everlasting love.
