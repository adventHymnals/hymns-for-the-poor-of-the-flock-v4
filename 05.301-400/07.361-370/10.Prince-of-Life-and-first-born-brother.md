1. Prince of life, and first-born brother
Of the chosen family,—
Brightness of the Father’s glory,
All Whose fulness dwells in Thee,— 
God and kinsman,
We extol Thy majesty.

2. Gladly with Thee we will suffer,
Since we hope with Thee to reign; 
Keep us, then, as servants mindful 
Of our Master’s toil and pain,
Till we see Thee,
In Thy glory, come again.
