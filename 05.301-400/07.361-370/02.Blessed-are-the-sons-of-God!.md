## 362. Blessed are the sons of God!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Blessed are the sons of God!
They are bought with Jesu’s blood;
They are ransom’d from the grave;
Life eternal they shall have.

2. God did love them in His Son 
Long before the world begun;
They the seal of this receiv’d 
When on Jesus they believ’d.

3. They are lights upon the earth,
Children of an heav’nly b irth;
Born of God, they hate all sin,
God’s pure seed remains within.

4. They have fellowship with God 
Through the Mediator’s blood:
One with God, with Jesus one,
Glory is in them begun.

5. They alone are truly bless’d,
Heirs of God, joint heirs with C hrist; 
Blessed this fraternity,
Here and in eternity!
