## 364. Behold the temple of the Lord!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Behold the temple of the L ord!
God’s building, where, by saints ador’d,
His presence He reveals:
Jehovah-Jesus, God of peace,
Rears it to be His resting place,
And there His glory dwells.365

2. A temple this not made with hands,
The workmanship of grace it stands,
And ever shall endure:
’Tis founded on the “Living Stone,”
And mid all changes shall be known, 
Immutably secure.

3. Time, that all other work destroys,
Combin’d with power that hell employs,
With safety it defies:
Erected for God’s own name’s sake,
Though earth with deep convulsions shake, 
Majestic it shall rise.

4. Age after age the work goes on;
Soon shall we hear the voice, “’Tis done,” 
And hail its crowning stone;
With all the armies of the sky,
" Grace! Grace unto i t!” we shall cry 
And Jesu’s praise make known.
