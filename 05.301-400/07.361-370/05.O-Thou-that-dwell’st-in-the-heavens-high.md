1. O Thou that dwell'st in the heavens high, 
Above yon stars, and within yon sky,
Where the dazzling fields never needed light, 
Of the sun by day, nor the moon by night!

2. Tho’ shining myriads around Thee stand,
For the sake of Him at Thy right hand;
O think of those that cost Him dear,
Still left’mid death and darkness here!

3. Our night is dreary, and dim our day;
And if Thou turnest Thy face away,
We are sinful, feeble, and helpless dust,
We have none to look to, and none to trust.

4. The pow’rs of darkness are all abroad,
They ask no Saviour, they seek no God; 
And us they scorn who await the day— 
Then turn not Thou Thy face away!

5. A life of scorn for us Thou didst lead,
And in the grave laid’st Thy blessed head; 
Then grant us grace, undauntedly
To lay down life and all for Thee.

6. Thine aid, O mighty One, we crave,
Nor shortened is Thine arm to save,
Afar from Thee we now sojourn—
Return to us, O Lord, re turn!
