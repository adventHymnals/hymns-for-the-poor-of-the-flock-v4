####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. See mercy, mercy from on high,
Descend to rebels doom’d to die;
’Tis mercy free, which knows no bound; 
How sweet, how blessed is the sound'

2. Soon as the reign of sin began,
The light of mercy dawn’d on man, 
When God announc’d the early news,
“The woman’s seed Thy head shall bruise.

3. Brightly it beam’d on men forlorn, 
When Christ, the holy child was born; 
And brighter still in splendour shone, 
When Jesus, dying, cried, “’Tis done 1”

4. The work complete when He arose, 
Bursting the snares of all His foes, 
When captive led captivity,
And took for us His seat on high.

5. Till we around Him then shall throng, 
This mercy shall be still our song;
And ev’ry scheme shall God confound 
Of all who strive its course to bound!
