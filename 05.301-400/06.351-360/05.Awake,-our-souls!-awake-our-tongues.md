1. Awake our souls! awake our tongues;
The subject is divine:
The Saviour’s love demands our songs; 
Let all His people join.

2. This Saviour is the Mighty God,
Who rests in heav’n above;
Reveal’d in flesh, He shed His blood, 
And thus declar’d God’s love.356

3. Jesus, Thy love exceeds our thought;
But this at least we see,
The soul that knows Thy pow’r is taught 
To value nought but Thee.

4. And though Thy love be faintly seen,
W h a t’s seen demands our praise; 
Without it, Lord, we still had been 
Engag’d in folly’s ways.
