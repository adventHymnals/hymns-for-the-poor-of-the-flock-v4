#### Advent Hymnals
## 360. Jesus! O name divinely sweet!
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Jesus! O name divinely sweet!
How charming is the sound!
What joyful news, what heavenly pow’r 
In Thy dear name is found.

2. Our souls, as guilty and condemn’d,
In hopeless fetters lay 
Our souls with numerous sins deprav’d,
To death and hell a prey.

3. Jesus, to purge away this guilt,
A willing victim fell,
And on His cross triumphant broke 
The bands of death and hell.
