1. The countless multitude on high,
That tune their songs to Jesu’s name, 
All merit of their own deny,
And Jesu’s worth alone proclaim.

2. Firm on the ground of sov’reign grace,
They stand before Jehovah’s throne; 
The only song in which blest place 
Is—“Thou art worthy 1 Thou alone!”

3. With spotless robes of purest white,
And branches of triumphal palm,351
They shout, with transports of delight, 
Heaven’s ceaseless universal psalm:—

4. “Salvation’s glory all be paid
To Him Who sits upon the throne;
And to the Lamb, Whose blood was shed, 
Thou! Thou art w orthy! Thou alone 1”

5. " For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood
These robes were wash’d so spotless pure 
Thou mad’st us kings and priests to God— 
For ever let Thy praise endure.”

6. While thus the ransom’d myriads shout,
“Amen,” the holy angels cry;
“Amen, Amen,” resounds throughout 
The boundless regions of the sky.

7. Let us with joy adopt the strain
We hope to sing for ever there;
“Worthy’s the Lamb for sinners slain, 
Worthy alone the crown to wear!”

8. W ithout one thought th at’s good to plead,
O what could shield us from despair 
But this, though we are vile indeed,
The Lord our Righteousness is there.
