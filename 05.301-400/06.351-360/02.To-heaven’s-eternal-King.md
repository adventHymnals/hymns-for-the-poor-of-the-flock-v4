1. To heaven’s eternal King
The praise of saints be giv’n;
His name, His glorious name we sing, 
The rightful Heir of heav’n.

2. He once was found with men,
A man of sorrows H e;
He bore His people’s sentence then,
He bore it on the tree.

3. He suffer’d in their stead,
He sav’d His people th u s;
The curse that fell upon His head, 
Was due, by right, to us.

4.’Twas love that brought Him down,
The purest, strongest love;
He bore the cross, He won the crown, 
And now He reigns above.

5. The praise of saints be given
To Him Who worthy is;
He died on earth—He lives in heav’n, 
Eternal praise be His.
