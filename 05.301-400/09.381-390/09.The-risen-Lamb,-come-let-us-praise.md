The Risen Lamb, come let us praise, In concert with the blest; Who, joyful in harmonious lays,  Employ an endless rest.

1. The Risen Lamb, come let us praise,
In concert with the blest;
Who, joyful in harmonious lays, 
Employ an endless rest.
Thus, Lord, while we remember Thee, 
We bless’d and patient grow;
And learn by hymns of praise to be 
Triumphant here below.

2. On this glad day a brighter scene
Of glory was display’d,
By God, the eternal Word, than when 
This universe was made:
For then He rose, the church Who bought 
With grief and pain extreme:
’Twas great to speak a world from nought; 
’Twas greater to redeem.
