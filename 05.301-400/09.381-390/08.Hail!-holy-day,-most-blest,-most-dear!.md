1. H a il 1 holy day, most blest, most dear! 
When death’s dark region, sad and drear, 
Those strange mysterious sounds did hear, 
“ The Lord is risen."12
lord’s d ay m o r n ing.

2. The holy Captive’s bonds are riven,
To Him the keys of death are given,
Be glad, O earth, and shout, 0 heaven!
“ The Lord is risen.”

3. Shall this triumphant theme inspire 
The angel’s song, the seraph’s lyre,
And saints not sing with such a choir,
“ The Lord is risen” ?

4. For not for them His life He gave;
He did not die their souls to save;
It is for man that from the grave
“ The Lord is risen.”

5. For man He left His glorious throne,
For man to death’s dark realm went down 
And now to heaven for man alone
“ The Lord is risen! ”
