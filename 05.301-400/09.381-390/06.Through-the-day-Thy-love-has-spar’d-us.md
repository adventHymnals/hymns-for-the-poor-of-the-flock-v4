```txt
1. Through the day Thy love has spar’d us, 
Wearied now we part for rest; 
Throughthe silent watches guard us,
Let no foe our peace molest:
Jesus ! Thou our guardian be,
Sweet it is to trust in Thee.

2. Pilgrims here on earth, and strangers, 
Dwelling in the midst of foes;
Us, and ours preserve from dangers, 
In Thine arms may we repose:
And when man’s sad day is past,
Rest with Thee in heav’n at last.
