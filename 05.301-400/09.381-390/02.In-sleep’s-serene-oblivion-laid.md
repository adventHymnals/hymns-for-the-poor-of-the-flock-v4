####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. In sleep’s serene oblivion laid,
I safely pass’d the silent night;
Again I see the breaking shade,
I drink again the morning light.

2. Refresh’d, I bless the waking hour,
Once more, with awe, rejoice to be;
My conscious soul resumes her power, 
And springs, my Saviour God, to Thee !

3. 0 guide me through the various maze, 
Which I and Thine are forced to tread ; 
And spread Thy shield’s protecting blaze, 
Where dangers press around my head.
