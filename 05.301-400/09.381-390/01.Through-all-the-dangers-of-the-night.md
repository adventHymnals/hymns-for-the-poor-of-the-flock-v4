1. T h rough all th e dangers o f the n ig h t,
Preserv’d, O Lord, by Thee,
Again we hail the cheerful light,
Again we bow the knee.

2. 0  may the beams of truth divine,
With pure convincing light,
In all our understandings shine,
And clear our mental sight.

3. Preserve us, Lord, throughout the day,
And guide us by Thine arm ;
For they are safe, and only they,
Whom Thou dost keep from harm.

4. Let all our words and all our ways
Declare that we are Thine;
That so the light of truth and grace 
Before the wrorld may shine.

5. Nor let us turn away from Thee;
Dear Saviour, hold us fast,
Till with immortal eyes we see 
Thy glorious face at last.
