```txt
1. G od o f m y life, w ith g rateful he art,
My ev’ning song I raise ;
But, 0 Thy thousand, thousand gifts 
Exceed my highest praise.

2. What shall I render for the care
Which me this day has kept?
A thankful heart, though no return,
Thy grace will still accept.

3. The sins and follies, holy God,
Which 1 this day have done,
I would confess with grief; and pray 
For pardon through Thy Son.

4. Much of my precious time I’ve lost:
This sinful waste forgive ;
And one day nearer now—to Thee,
Lord, teach me now to live.
