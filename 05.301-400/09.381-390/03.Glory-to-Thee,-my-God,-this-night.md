1. G lory  to Thee, my God, this night,
For all the blessings of the light;
Keep me, 0 keep me, King of kings, 
Under Thine own Almighty wings.

2. Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
The ills that I this day have done;
That with the world, myself, and Thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

3. 0 may my soul on Thee repose,
And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close; 
Sleep, that may me more active make,
To serve my God when I awake.

4. Should death itself my sleep invade,
Why should I be of death afraid ? 
Protected by Thy saving arm,
Tho’ death may strike, it cannot harm.


5. For death is life, and labour rest,
When with Thy gracious presence blest; 
Then welcome sleep or death to me,
I’m still secure, for still with Thee.

6. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow, 
Praise Him, all creatures here below: 
Praise Him above, ye heav’nly host, 
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
