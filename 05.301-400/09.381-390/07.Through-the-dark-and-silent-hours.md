####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Th rough the dark and silent h ours
Of the night, preserve us, Lord ! 
Safely keep both us and ours,
Peace and confidence afford:
We are bold, in Thee confiding,
Safe beneath Thy shade abiding.

2. Since we cannot tell to-day
What to-morrow’s dawn may bring; 
Saviour, draw our hearts away 
Far from ev’ry earthly thing:
Make us, in Thy service steady, 
Always for Thy coming ready.
