####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Now Father, let our evening songs
Like holy incense rise;
And let the off’rings of our tongues 
Be holy sacrifice.

2. Through all the dangers of the day
Thyself for us hast car’d ;
And still to drive our wants away,
Thy mercy stands prepar’d.

3. Perpetual blessings from above
Encompass us around;
But a h! how few returns of love 
Hath our Redeemer found.

4. What have we done for Him Who died
To save our sinful souls ?
Alas ! our sins are multiplied,
Fast as each minute rolls.


5. Yet with these sin-stain’d lives of ours, 
Lord, to Thy blood we flee;
And yield them up with all their powers, 
To be renew’d by Thee.
