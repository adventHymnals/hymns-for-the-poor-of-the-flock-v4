1. A h! who upon earth can conceive
The bliss that in heaven Saints share? 
Or who this dark world would not leave, 
And earnestly long to be there?
There Christ is the light and the sun,
His glories unhinder’dly shine;
His presence their spirits have won.
And rest in the glory divine.

2.’Tis good, at His word, to be here,
Yet better it is to be gone,
And there in His presence appear,
And rest as He rests on the throne; 
Yet a h! it will gladden our eyes,
When Him we behold on the cloud, 
And echo the joys of the skies,
And shout to the trum pet of God.
