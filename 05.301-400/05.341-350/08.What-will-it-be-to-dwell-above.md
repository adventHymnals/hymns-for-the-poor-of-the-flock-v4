1. W hat will it be to dwell above,
And with the Lord of glory reign, 
Since the sweet earnest of His love,
So brightens all th is dreary plain:
No heart can think, no tongue explain, 
What jo y’t will be with Christ to reign.

2. When sin no more obstructs our sight,
And flesh and sense deceive no more, 
When we shall see the Prince of light, 
And all His works of grace explore: 
What heights and depths of love divine, 
Will there through endless ages shine!

3. And God has fix’d the happy day,
When the last tear shall dim our eyes, 
When He will wipe these tears away, 
And fill our hearts with glad surprise; 
To hear His voice, and see His face,
And feel His infinite embrace.

4. This is the joy we seek to know.
For this with patience we would wait, 
Till call’d from earth and all below,
We mount to our celestial seat;
To wave our palms, and wear the crown, 
And at His feet to cast them down.
