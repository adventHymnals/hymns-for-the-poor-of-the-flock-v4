        Hymns for the Poor of the Flock 346. Above the clouds a city stands. Above the clouds a city stands, Of living stones not made with hands,  Where God the Saviour’ll reign: Tis built for sinners bought with blood,  Redeem’d and sanctified to God, And cleans’d from every stain.

## 346. Above the clouds a city stands
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Above the clouds a city stands,
Of living stones not made with hands, 
Where God the Saviour’ll reign:
Tis built for sinners bought with blood, 
Redeem’d and sanctified to God,
And cleans’d from every stain.

2. The cities of this world must fall, 
However solid, they must all
The common ruin share;
But yonder city still appears 
Unchangeable through endless years, 
For God Himself is there,

3. Happy the saints who shall abide 
Within those walls, and there reside
For ever with the K ing;
We hope that we shall soon be there, 
Its joys and blessedness to share,
The Saviour’s praise to sing.347—348
