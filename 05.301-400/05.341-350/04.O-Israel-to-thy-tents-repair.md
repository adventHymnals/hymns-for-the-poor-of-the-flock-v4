####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O Israel, to thy tents repair,
Why so secure on hostile ground? 
The King commands thee to beware, 
For many foes thy camp surround.

2. The trumpet sounds a martial strain,
Then Israel gird thee for the fight; 
Arise, the combat to maintain,
And put thine enemies to flight.345

3. Thou should’st not sleep as others do,
Awake, be vigilant, be brave;
The coward and the sluggard too,
Must wear the fetters of the slave.

4. A nobler lot is cast for thee,
Fair Canaan’s spread before thine eyes: 
With such a hope, shall Israel flee?
Or yield through weariness the prize?

5. No, though a careless world repose,
And slumber on through life’s short day, 
God’s Israel to the conflict goes,
And bears the glorious prize away.
