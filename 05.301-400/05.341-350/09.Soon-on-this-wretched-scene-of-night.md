1. Soon on this wretched scene of night 
Unbounded bliss shall rise,
And realms of infinite delight 
Shall gladden mortal eyes.

2. There pain and sickness ne’er shall come,
There man shall ne’er complain;
But all who reach that peaceful home, 
With Jesus there shall reign.

3. No cloud that region e’er shall know
For ever bright and fair;
For sin, the source of mortal woe,
Can never enter there.

4. O may the heav’nly vision fire
Our hearts with ardent love,
Till wings of faith and strong desire 
Bear ev’ry thought above.
