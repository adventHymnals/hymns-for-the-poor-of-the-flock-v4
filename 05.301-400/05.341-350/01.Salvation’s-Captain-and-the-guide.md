####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Salvation’s Captain, and the guide
Of all that seek the rest above,
Beneath Thy shadow we abide,
The cloud of Thy protecting love;
Our strength Thy grace, our rule Thy word, 
Our end, the glory of our Lord.

2. By Thine unerring Spirit led,
We shall not in the desert stray,
Or light for our direction need,
Or lose, though dark and drear, our way, 
But kept from danger, and from fear,
Since Thine Almighty love is near.
