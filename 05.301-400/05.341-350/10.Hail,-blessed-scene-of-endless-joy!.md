####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Hail, blessed scene of endless jo y!
Where Jesus shall for ever reign,
Where nothing hurtful shall annoy,
But gladness fill the happy plain:
Free from all sin, and free from fear,
None shall e’er sigh or shed a tear.

2. Ten thousand thousands then shall raise
Their joyful notes, and sing this strain;
Awake the song of grateful praise,
Unto the Lamb Who once was slain. 
Hosannas, loud hosannas sing,
Hosannas to th’ eternal King.

3. Forever there with Jesus blest,
They fear no death, and feel no pain, 
But there shall be in endless rest,
Where dangers ne’er shall threat again; 
For Jesus reigns, and they shall share 
With Him His fullest glory there.
