####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Lord o f my life, 0 may Thy praise
Employ my noblest pow’r s ;
Whose goodness lengthens out my days,
And fills the circling hours.

2. Preserv’d by Thine almighty arm,
I pass’d the shades of night,
Serene, and safe from every harm,
And see returning light.

3. While many spent the night in sighs,
And restless pains and woes;
In gentle sleep I clos’d mine eyes,
And undisturb’d repose.

4. When sleep, death’s semblance, o’er me spread
And I unconscious lay,
Thy watchful care was round my bed,
To guard my feeble clay.

5. 0 let the same almighty care
My waking hours attend ;
From every danger, every snare,
My trembling steps defend.

6. Smile on the minutes as they roll,
And guide my future days ;
And let Thy goodness fill my soul 
With gratitude and praise.
