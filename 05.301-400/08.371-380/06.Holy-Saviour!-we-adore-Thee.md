1. Holy Saviour! we adore Thee,
Seated on the throne of God;
While the heav’nly hosts before Thee, 
Gladly sing Thy praise aloud.
“Thou art worthy!
We were ransom’d by Thy blood.”

2. Saviour! though the world despis’d Thee,
Though Thou here wast crucified,
Yet the Father’s glory rais’d Thee,
Lord of all creation wide;
“Thou art worthy!
We shall live, for Thou hast died.”

3. And though here on earth rejected,
’Tis but fellowship with Thee,
What besides could be expected,
Than like Thee our Lord to be?
“Thou art worthy!
Thou from earth hast set us free.”

4. Haste the day of Thy returning,
With Thy ransom’d church to reign;
Then shall end our days of mourning, 
We shall sing with rapture then,
“Thou art worthy! ”
“Come, Lord Jesus, Come. Amen 1”
