####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
And hast refresh’d me while I slept!
Guard the first springs of thought and will, 
And with Thyself my spirit fill.

3. Direct, control, suggest this day 
All I may think, or do, or say ;
That all my powers, with all their might, 
For Thy sole glory may unite.

4. Heaven, Lord, is there where’er Thou art; 
0 never then from me depart;
For to my soul ’twere hell, to be 
But for one moment void of Thee.

5. Praise God from Whom all blessings flow, 
Praise Him, all creatures here below: 
Praise Him above, ye heav’nly host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
