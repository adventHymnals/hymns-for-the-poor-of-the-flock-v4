####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. T h e day th at Jesus rose should be
Remember’d by His friends;
Upon His rising, all agree,
Their hope of heaven depends.

2. If Jesus rose not from the dead,
His people’s hope is vain ;
He then would have no power to save, 
Nor should they live again.

3. But now is Jesus ris’n indeed,
And He “ the first-fruits” is ;
The first-fruits of the ransom’d seed, 
Of those He claims as His.

4. As He is ris’n, so they shall rise;
As He lives, so shall they:
A dwelling theirs beyond the skies, 
And theirs a glorious day.
b The hope that Jesus shall appear, 
And take His saints to heav’n,
To dwell with Him for ever there; 
This hope to saints is giv’n.
