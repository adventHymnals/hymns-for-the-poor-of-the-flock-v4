1. T h e week’s first day is that on w hich 
The Saviour left the grave:
We sing of Him in mercy rich ;
His arm is strong to save.

2. He drank a bitter cup for us,
How bitter, who can tell ?
’Twas thus He paid our debt, and thus 
He saved our souls from hell.

3. We hail the day, the week’s first day,
The day the Saviour rose:
The Lord, He bore our sins away ; 
From this our comfort flows.

4. From this there flows a rich supply
Of all we can require;
Tis pardon, peace, and holy joy— 
What more can we desire ?

5. What more, but that we may sustain
Untir’d the holy strife ;
And then, with all the victors, gain 
A crown, the crown of life?
