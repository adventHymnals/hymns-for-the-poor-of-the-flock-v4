“ For we which have believed do enter into rest."— 
Heb. iv. 3., con. Mat. xi. 23—30.

1. I rest in Christ the Son of God,
Who took the servant’s form;
By faith I flee to Jesu’s cross,
My covert from the storm.

2. At peace with God, no ills I dread,
The cup of blessing m ine;.
The Lord is risen, His precious blood 
Is new and living wine.

3. Jesus put all my sins away
When bruised to make me whole:
Who shall accuse or who condemn 
My blameless ransom’d soul ?

4. O thou destroyer, see the blood
That makes the guilty clean,
No prey of thine the soul on which 
This token once is seen.
