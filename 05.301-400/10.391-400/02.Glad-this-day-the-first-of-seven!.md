####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. G lad this day, th e first o f sev’n ,
Glad we sing, “ The Lord is ris’n,” 
Christ our King, the Lord from heav’n, 
Rose this day, and left His pris’n.

2. Left the grave, awhile His pris’n.
Left it, to return no more:
Sing we then, “ The Lord is ris’n,” 
Sing His name, Whom saints adore.

3. Since He rose, His saints shall rise;
Since He lives, His saints shall live: 
Theirs are everlasting joys,
All is theirs that grace can give.
