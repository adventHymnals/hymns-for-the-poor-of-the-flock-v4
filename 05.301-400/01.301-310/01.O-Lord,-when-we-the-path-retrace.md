####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O Lord, when we the path retrace
Which Thou on earth hast trod,
To man Thy wond’rous love and grace, 
Thy faithfulness to God.

2. Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
Prov’d stronger than the grave;
The very spear that pierced Thy side 
Drew forth the blood to save.

3. Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
’Midst darkness only light,
Thou didst Thy Father’s name confess, 
And in His will delight.

4. Unmoved by Satan’s subtle wiles,
Or suffering, shame and loss,
Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles, 
Led only to the Cross.

5. O Lord, with sorrow and with shame,
We meekly would confess,
How little we who bear Thy name, 
Thy mind, Thy ways express.

6. Give us Thy meek, Thy lowly mind,
We would obedient be,
And all our rest and pleasure find 
In learning, Lord, of Thee.
