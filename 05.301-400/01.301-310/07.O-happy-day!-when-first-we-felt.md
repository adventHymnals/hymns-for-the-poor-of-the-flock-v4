## 307. O happy day! when first we felt
####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. O h a p p y day! when first we felt 
Our souls with true contrition m e lt;
And all our sins of crimson guilt 
Were cleansed by blood on Calv’ry spilt.

2. O happy day! when Jesus’ love 
Began our grateful hearts to move,
And gazing on the wond’rous cross,
We saw all else as worthless dross.

3. O happy day! when, sin no more,
We meet Him Whom our souls adore; 
When sorrows, conflicts, fears, shall cease, 
And all our trials end in peace.

4. O happy day! when we shall see,
And cast our longing eyes on Thee;
On Thee our light, our life, our love,
Our all below, our heaven above.308

5. O happy day of cloudless light!
Eternal day without a night!
Lord, when shall we its dawning see, 
And spend it all in praising Thee?

6. Come, Saviour, come! O quickly come! 
Take us Thy waiting people home;
We long to stand around Thy throne,
To love and serve Thee, Lord, alone.
