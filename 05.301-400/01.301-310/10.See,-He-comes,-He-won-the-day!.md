1. See, He comes, He won the day! 
Go ye forth to meet H im;
Bring the palm, and strew the way, 
And with singing greet Him.
Jesus is the victor’s name,
Jesus, Lord of glory!
Fly, ye heralds, spread His fame, 
Tell the joyful story.

2. Well His people now may sing,
Sing with exultation;
Since the victor is their King,
And He brings salvation.
Make the Saviour’s triumph known, 
Let the nations hear i t;
He alone deserves the crown,
He alone shall wear it.
