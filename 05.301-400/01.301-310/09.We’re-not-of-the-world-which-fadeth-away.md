####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

1. We’re not of the world which fadeth away. 
We’re not of the night, but children of day; 
The chains th at once bound us, by Jesus are
riv’n,
We’re strangers on earth, and our home is 
in heav’n.

2. Our path is most rugged, and dang’rous too, 
A wide trackless waste our journey lies
through;310
But the Pillar of Cloud that shews us our way, 
Is our sure light by night, and shades us by 
day.

3. Our Shepherd is still our Guardian and Guide, 
Before us He goes to help and provide;
We drink of the streams from the Rock that 
was riv’n,
Our bread is the Manna that came down from 
heav’n.

4. Mid mightiest foes—most feeble are we— 
Yet trembling in ev’ry conflict they flee;
The Lord is our Banner— the battle is His- 
The weakest of saints more than conqueror is.

5. Soon shall we enter our own promis’d land, 
Before His bright throne in glory shall stand: 
Our song then for ever and ever shall be,
“All glory and blessing, Lord Jesus, to Thee!”
