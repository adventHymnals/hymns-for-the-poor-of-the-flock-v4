1. Jesus comes by crowds attended,
Heav’n the dazzling train supplies:
Call the dead; the night is ended;
Bid the sleeping dust arise:
Let the ransom’d 
Join the Saviour in the skies.

2.’Tis the day so long expected;
Shout, ye saints, and triumph now;
See your Lord, by man rejected;
Many crowns adorn His brow;
’Tis His triumph:
Ev’ry knee to Him shall bow.
