1. Sing aloud to God, our strength;
He has brought us hitherto;
He will bring us home at length;
This the Lord our God will do: 
Doubt not, for His word is stable; 
Fear not, for His arm is able.

2. Sing aloud to God, our strength • 
Sing with wonder of His love;
Who can tell its breadth and length?
Who below, or who above?
Who its depth and height can measure? 
’Tis a rich unbounded treasure!

3. Sing aloud to God, our strength;
He is with us where we go;
Fear we not the journey’s length,
Fear we not the mighty foe:
All our foes shall be defeated,
And our journey be completed.
