1. O d r a w me, Saviour, after Thee,
So shall I run, and never tire:
With gracious words still comfort me,
Be Thou my hope, my sole desire;
Free me from every w eight: nor fear,
Nor sin can come, if Thou art near.

2. W hat in Thy love possess I not?
My star hy night, my sun by day,
My spring of life, when parchâ€™d with drought, 
My wine to cheer, my bread to stay,
My strength, my shield, my safe abode,
My robe before the throne of G od!

3. From all Eternity with love
Unchangeable Thou hast me viewed;
Ere knew this beating heart to move,
Thy tender mercies me pursued:
Ever with me may they abide,
And close me in on every side.
