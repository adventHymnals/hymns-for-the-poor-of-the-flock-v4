####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. Soon shall our Master come,
Our toil and sorrow cease;
He’ll call His waiting servants home, 
And all be joy and peace.

2. Now may we do His will,
In all His footsteps tread;
And, in a world of evil, still 
To grieve Him only dread.312

3. May we His name confess
’Midst suffering, shame, and loss; 
Stand forth His faithful witnesses,
And glory in the Cross.

4. Watchful may each be found,
Our loins well girded b e;
In works of faith and love abound,
Till we our Master see.

5. Then shall we soar above,
Nor cease our sweet employ;
And hear Him say, with tend’rest love, 
“Enter Thy Master's joy.”
