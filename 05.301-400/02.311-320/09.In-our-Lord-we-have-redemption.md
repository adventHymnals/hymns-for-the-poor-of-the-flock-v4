####  Hymns for the Poor of the Flock

```txt
1. In our Lord we have redemption,
Full remission in His blood;
From the curse entire exemption,
From the curse pronounc’d by God: 
W hat a Saviour Jesus is!
O what love, what love is His!

2. Praise be His, all praise transcending, .
Praise on earth, and praise in heav’n; 
Praise through ages never-ending,
To the Lamb of God be giv’n:
He alone the Saviour is,
Everlasting praise be His.
