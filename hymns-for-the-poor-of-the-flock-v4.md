## 1.  'Glory, glory everlasting.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14VeSmoHYenO5rEfldSrfpMEGka9pjS6q/edit?mode=html)



    1. Glory, glory everlasting,
    Be to Him Who bore the cross, 
    Who redeem’d our souls by tasting 
    Death, the death deserv’d by us!
    Spread His glory 
    Who redeem’d His people thus.

    2. His is love, ’tis love unbounded,
    Without measure, without end;
    Human thought is here confounded; 
    ’Tis too vast to comprehend: 
    Praise the Saviour!
    Magnify the sinners’ friend.

    3. While we tell the wondrous story
    Of the Saviour’s cross and shame, 
    Sing we—“Everlasting glory 
    Be to God and to the Lamb.” 
    Saints and angels,
    Give ye glory to His name.
 
 

## 2.  'We''ll sing of the Shepherd that died.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14i57rCyFn2jGvzkRWJGjLU3Fq6DYqoOY/edit?mode=html)



    1. We’ll sing of the Shepherd that died,
    That died for the sake of the flock;
    His love to the utmost was tried,
    But firmly endur’d as a rock.

    2. When blood from a victim must flow,
    This Shepherd, by pity, was led 
    To stand between us and the foe,
    And willingly died in our stead.

    3. Our song then forever shall be,
    Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus; 
    No subject’s so glorious as He,
    No theme’s so affecting to us.

    4. ==We’ll sing of such subjects alone,
    None other our tongues shall employ; 
    Till better His love becomes known,
    In yonder bright regions of joy.==
 
 

## 3.  'Head of the church triumphant!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14bp1BmbGy0bUHjSFWCuxnIqCqW2cSMKk/edit?mode=html)



    1. Head of the church triumphant!
    We joyfully adore Thee,
    ’Till Thou appear 
    Thy members here
    Would sing like those in glory! 
    We lift our hearts and voices,
    In blest anticipation,
    And cry aloud,
    And give to God 
    The praise of our salvation.

    2. While in affliction’s furnace,
    And passing through the fire;
    The love we praise 
    Which tries our ways,
    And ever brings us nigher;
    We clap our hands, exulting,
    In Thine almighty favour,
    The love divine 
    Which made us Thine,
    Shall keep us Thine forever.

    3. Thou dost conduct Thy people, 
    Through torrents of temptation;
    Nor will we fear,
    While Thou art near 
    The fire of tribulation:
    The World, with Sin and Satan, 
    In vain our march opposes;
    By Thee we shall 
    Break through them all,
    And sing the song of Moses.

    4. By faith we see the glory 
    Of which Thou dost assure us,
    The world despise 
    For that high prize 
    Which Thou hast set before us; 
    And if Thou count us worthy,
    We each would die like Stephen, 
    And see Thee stand 
    At God’s right hand,
    To take us up to heaven.
 
 

## 4.  'Lo! He comes with clouds descending.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Tt0V2IVolzxYnPh7riRHxEwTUlrzsDj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lo! He comes, with clouds descending
    Once for favor’d sinners slain! 
    Thousand thousand saints attending, 
    Swell the triumph of His train! 
    Hallelujah!
    Jesus comes and comes to reign.

    2. Now redemption, long expected,
    See in solemn pomp appear!
    All His saints, by man rejected,
    Rise to meet Him in the air. 
    Hallelujah!
    See the day of God appear!

    3. Israel, too, shall now behold Him,
    Full of grace and majesty,
    Tho’ they set at nought and sold Him, 
    Pierc’d and nail’d Him to the tree, 
    Now returning,
    He their lov’d Messiah’ll be.

    4. Answer Thine own Bride and Spirit,
    Hasten, Lord, and quickly come;
    The glory promis’d to inherit,
    Take Thy waiting people home.
    All creation
    Travails, groans, and bids Thee come.

    5. Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee,
    High on Thine exalted throne: 
    Saviour, take the power and glory: 
    Claim the kingdoms for Thine own: 
    O come quickly!
    Hallelujah! come, Lord, come!
 
 

## 5.  'Glory to God on High!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UQUO9tyIJLasjq81kOuBTu5hn5c9UeB/edit?mode=html)



    1. Glory to God on High!
    Let Heav’n and Earth reply,
    *“Praise ye His name"*
    All Heaven’s hosts adore 
    Him Who our sorrows bore, 
    Crying for evermore,
    *“Worthy the Lamb”*

    2. They who surround the throne 
    Blissfully join in one,
    *Praising His name.*
    We too, who know His blood 
    Hath sealed our peace with God, 
    Will sound His fame abroad,
    *“Worthy the Lamb"*

    3. Join, all the ransom’d race,
    Our Lord and God to bless,
    *“Praise ye His name!”*
    Tell what His arm hath done! 
    What spoils from death He won! 
    Sing His great name alone!
    *“Worthy the Lamb!”*

    4. Jesus, our Lord and God,
    Bore sin’s tremendous load,
    *“Praise ye His name!”* 
    In Him will we rejoice,
    Making a cheerful noise,
    And shout with heart and voice,
    “Worthy the Lamb!”*

    5. And if we change our place,
    Yet shall we never cease 
    *Praising His name;*
    But still the offering 
    Of praise to Him shall bring,
    And without ceasing sing 
    *“Worthy the Lamb!”*
 
 

## 6.  'O Jesus Christ, most holy.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nhUcg9QqII7IhIxH4wRZNP6WuViAo16/edit?mode=html)



    O Jesus Christ, most holy—
    Head of the Church, Thy bride,
    In us each day more fully 
    Thy name be magnified!
    O may, in each believer,
    Thy love its pow’r display,
    And none amongst us ever
    From Thee, our Shepherd, stray!
 
 

## 7.  '"Abba," Father,Lord! we call Thee.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14i3bjomFkJ50YeJWOmu%2DgybemHjF80WE/edit?mode=html)



    1. “Abba,” Father,—Lord! we call Thee, 
    (Hallow’d name!) from day to day;— 
    ’Tis Thy children’s right to know Thee, 
    None but children, “Abba,” say.
    This high glory we inherit,
    Thy free gift, through Jesus’ blood; 
    ~~God the Spirit~~ Holy Spirit, with our spirit, 
    Witnesseth we’re Sons of God.

    2. Abba’s purpose gave us being,
    When in Christ, in that vast plan. 
    Abba chose the church in Jesus,
    Long before the world began;
    O what love the Father bore us!
    O how precious in His sight!— 
    When He gave His church to Jesus! 
    Jesus, His whole soul’s delight!

    3. Though our nature’s fall in Adam,
    Seem’d to shut us out from God, 
    Thus it was His counsel brought us 
    Nearer still, thro’ Jesus’ blood;
    For in Him we found redemption, 
    Grace and Glory in the Son,
    O the height and depth of Mercy!
    “Christ and the elect are one.”
 
 

## 8.  'Richest stores of heav''nly blessings.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14endpVxkfN0TZ3bI1Oz9MFn2GWO%2DFvmF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Richest stores of Heav’nly blessings 
    God has giv’n in Christ, His Son— 
    With the Holy Spirit’s power,
    Safe to lead His children on. 
    “Abba,” Father, makes all certain, 
    E’en by word, and oath, and blood;- 
    Abba saith, “They are My children,” 
    And they say, "Our Abba’s GOD.”

    2. Hence, through all the changing seasons, 
    Trouble, sorrow, sickness, woe, 
    Nothing changeth God’s affection,
    Abba’s love shall bring us through. 
    Soon shall all the blood-bought children, 
    Round the throne their anthems raise; 
    And, in songs of rich salvation,
    Shout to Abba endless praise.

    CHORUS.
    “Abba,” Father! Lord, we’ll call Thee, 
    Abba’ll sound through all the host;
    All in heav’n and earth adoring,
    Father, Son, ~~and~~by Holy Ghost!^and^ ^not^ ^inscripture.^ ^by^ ^-^ ^1^ ^Cor^ ^12:3,^ ^etc^
 
 

## 9.  Ere God had built the mountains.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/152_w6TSJ1sTtcl36sNf34EYZEzswm_%2D8/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ere God had built the mountains, 
    Or rais’d the fruitful hills,
    Before He fill’d the fountains,
    That feed the running rills;
    In Thee, from everlasting,
    The wonderful I AM 
    Found pleasures never wasting, 
    And Wisdom is Thy name.

    2. When like a tent to dwell in,
    He spread the skies abroad,
    And swath’d about the swelling 
    Of ocean’s mighty flood:
    He wrought by weight and measure;
    And Thou wast with Him then: 
    Thyself the Father’s pleasure,
    And Thine, the sons of men.

    3. Thus Wisdom’s works discover
    Thy glory and Thy grace,
    Thou everlasting Lover 
    Of our unworthy race!
    Thy gracious eye survey’d us 
    Ere stars were seen above;
    In wisdom Thou hast made us,
    And died for us in love.
 
 

## 10.  'Come, let us join our cheerful songs'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/152MjIOHKPGK34S4Vz%2DqygC%2D2bZZT9JkY/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, let us join our cheerful songs
    With angels round the throne:
    Ten thousand thousand are their tongues, 
    But all their joys are one.

    2. “Worthy the Lamb that died,” they cry,
    “To be exalted thus:”
    “Worthy the Lamb,” our lips reply,
    “For He was slain for us.”

    3. Jesus is worthy to receive
    Honour and pow’r divine:
    And blessings more than we can give, 
    Be, Lord, for ever Thine.

    4. Let all that dwell above the sky,
    A joyful anthem raise,
    Join to exalt Thy glories high,
    And speak Thine endless praise.

    5. Redeem’d creation join in one,
    To bless the sacred name 
    Of Him th at sits upon the throne, 
    And to adore the Lamb.
 
 

## 11.  Though troubles assail.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12wEp%2DueOHO7iPVSib74pBqpVH3vo5mfW/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though troubles assail,
    And dangers affright, 
    Though friends should all fail, 
    And foes all unite:
    Yet one thing secures us 
    Whatever betide,
    The Scripture assures us,
    The Lord will provide.

    2. The birds without barn
    Or storehouse are fed, 
    From them let us learn 
    To trust for our bread:
    His saints, what is fitting, 
    Shall ne’er be denied,
    So long as’tis written 
    The Lord will provide.

    3. "We may, like the ships,
    By tempests be tost 
    On perilous deeps,
    But cannot be lost: 
    Though Satan enrages 
    The wind and the tide, 
    The promise engages 
    The Lord will provide.

    4. His call we obey,
    Like Abram of old,
    Not knowing our way,
    But faith makes us bold; 
    For though we are strangers, 
    We have a sure guide,
    And trust in all dangers 
    The Lord will provide.
 
 

## 12.  When Satan appears.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jL84vRacSZV6gnMAeq3mqX_QLKViGgB/edit?mode=html)



    1. When Satan appears
    To stop up our path,
    And fill us with fears,
    We triumph by faith;
    He cannot take from us, 
    Though oft he has tried,
    This heart-cheering promise,— 
    The Lord will provide.

    2. He tells us we’re weak,
    Our hope is in vain,
    The good that we seek 
    We ne’er shall obtain;
    But when such suggestions 
    Our spirits have tried,
    This answers all questions,— 
    The Lord will provide.

    3. No strength of our own
    Or goodness we claim;
    Yet since we have known 
    The Savior’s great name,
    In this our strong tower 
    For safety we hide,
    The Lord is our power,
    The Lord will provide.

    4. Should life sink apace,
    And death be in view,
    This word of His grace 
    Shall comfort us through:
    No fearing or doubting,—
    With Christ on their side 
    Who cannot die shouting, 
    The Lord will provide?
 
 

## 13.  One there is above all others.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/139MptquxE_QL5fzpK3WHnFd%2D0%2D%2DGctA0/edit?mode=html)



    1. One there is, above all others,
    Well deserves the name of Friend! 
    His is love beyond a brother’s,
    Costly, free, and knows no end: 
    They who once His kindness prove, 
    Find it everlasting love!

    2. Which of all our friends to save us,
    Could or would have shed his blood? 
    But our Jesus died to have us 
    Reconcil’d in Him to God:
    This was boundless love indeed!
    Jesus is a Friend in need.

    3. When He liv’d on earth abased,
    “Friend of Sinners” was His name; 
    Now above all glory raised,
    He rejoices in the same:
    Saints He calls His “brethren, friends,” 
    And to all their wants attends.

    4. O! for grace our hearts to soften;
    Teach us, Saviour, love for love;
    We, alas! forget too often,
    What a Friend we have above:
    Thus may all Thy saints be taught,
    How to love Thee as they ought.
 
 

## 14.  'We bless Thee, O Thou great Amen!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12mPzmCpmvI_Yf0h28E%2D8B6Nb5x8m3LCn/edit?mode=html)



    1. We bless Thee, O Thou great Amen! 
    Jehovah’s pledge to sinful men,
    Confirming all His word!
    Doubtful no promises remain,
    For all are Yea, and all Amen,
    In Thee, our faithful Lord.

    2. How great the grace of God to bless 
    By Thee, the Lord our righteousness!
    By Thee, we say again:
    For to us all things thus are sure,
    Through life, in death, and evermore,
    By Thee, the Great Amen.

    3. O faithful Witness of our God,
    Who cain’st by water and by blood!
    In Thee (the Holy One)
    God’s record doth for ever stand,
    Of life eternal, from His hand,
    To all in Thee the Son.

    4. Gladly His promises we hear,
    For God’s “Amen” dispels all fear,
    His faithfulness it proves;
    And while such grace from God is shown, 
    To His Amen, we add our own:
    For our Amen He loves.
 
 

## 15.  'Children of God, in age or youth.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12urGS5z9dCc%2Db2zmnsbjml5IFdTduuea/edit?mode=html)



    1. Children of God, in age or youth,
    Who live by Christ, the God of truth—
    Secure in Him remain;
    Make Him what He is made to you,
    Your Alpha and Omega too,
    God’s Christ is your Amen.

    2. Nor less above, ye heav’nly host
    To Father, Son ~~and~~by Holy Ghost, ^and^ ^not^ ^inscripture.^ ^by^ ^-^ ^1^ ^Cor^ ^12:3,^ ^etc^
    Give praise for ransom’d men;
    For now to you, by them’s made known, 
    The richest wisdom ever shown,
    Thro’ Christ, the Great Amen.

    3. Secur'd in Him, the Church on High, 
    And saints below, may boldly cry, 
    Praise to our God Amen!
    To God in Christ all praise be giv’n— 
    For evermore on earth, in heav’n, 
    Amen! Amen! Amen!
 
 

## 16.  'Brethren, let us join to bless'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12hW3R0QIHcikzjZA4ShN0Jd3z14fBIBn/edit?mode=html)



    1. Brethren, let us join to bless 
    Jesus Christ, our joy and peace!
    Let our praise to Him be giv’n,
    High at God’s right hand in heav’n.

    2. Master, lo! to Thee we bow,
    Thou art Lord, and only Thou:
    Thou the virgin’s blessed seed,
    Thou the Church’s glorious Head.

    3. Thee the angels ceaseless sing,
    Thee we praise, The Priest and King; 
    Worthy is Thy name of praise,
    Full of glory, full of Grace!

    4. Joyful tidings Thou hast brought,
    Of salvation, by Thee wrought: 
    Wrought for all Thy church! and we 
    Worship in their company.

    5. We, Thy little flock, adore 
    Thee, the Lord, for evermore!
    Ever resting in Thy love,
    ’Till we join with those above.
 
 

## 17.  'Saviour, come, Thy Saints are waiting'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12mTwpznJHpMxi8ZFL6iKWZ30iiHTyLoH/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour, come, Thy Saints are waiting, 
    Waiting for the nuptial day,
    Thence their promis’d glory dating; 
    Come, and bear Thy saints away.
    Come, Lord Jesus,
    Thus Thy waiting people pray.

    2. Base the wish, and vain th’ endeavour, 
    While on earth to find our rest;
    Till we see Thy face, we never 
    Shall or can be fully blest;
    In Thy presence 
    Nothing shall our peace molest.

    3. Lord, we wait for Thine appearing; 
    “Tarry not” Thy people say;
    Bright the prospect is, and cheering,
    Of beholding Thee that day;
    When our sorrow 
    Shall for ever pass away.

    4. Till it comes, O keep us steady,
    Keep us walking in Thy ways;
    At Thy call may we be ready,
    And our Heads with triumph raise;
    Then with angels 
    Sing Thine everlasting praise.
 
 

## 18.  How good is the God we adore.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13UiEFScu2_%2Dv75AQtHSaDNOT_W_o4WuW/edit?mode=html)



    1. How good is the God we adore,
    Our faithful unchangeable Friend, 
    Whose love is as great as His power. 
    And knows neither measure nor end!

    2.’Tis Jesus, the First and the Last, 
    ==Whose Spirit== shall guide us safe home; 
    We’ll praise Him for all that is past, 
    And trust Him for all that’s to come.
 
 

## 19.  'Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/138IfS%2D68oDkXUmpm8GUhDD272wSnEIuq/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail, Thou once-despised Jesus!
    Hail, Thou Galilean king!
    Thou didst suffer to release us;
    Thou didst free salvation bring;
    Thro’ Thy death and resurrection, 
    Bearer of our sin and shame!
    We enjoy Divine protection,
    Life and glory through Thy name, 

    2. Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
    All our sins on Thee were laid:
    By Almighty Love anointed,
    Thou hast full atonement made:
    We who trust Thee are forgiven, 
    Through the virtue of Thy blood; 
    Rent in Thee the veil of heaven;
    Grace shines forth to man from God.
 
 

## 20.  'Jesus, hail! amid the glory.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13QGbyyrCeNX_j2Hys7Xs%2DSmZgpNVEi0s/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, hail! amid the glory,
    Where for us Thou dost abide;
    (All the heav’nly hosts adore Thee!) 
    Standing at Thy Father’s side,
    There for us Thou now art pleading;
    While Thou dost our place prepare, 
    For the church still interceding,
    Till in glory it appear.

    2. Worship, honour, power, and blessing, 
    Thou shalt then from all receive; 
    Loudest praises, without ceasing,
    All that earth or heav’n can give: 
    ’Till that day,—th’ angelic spirits, 
    With the church, in feebler lays, 
    Still shall try to sing Thy merits,
    And to chant Thy Father’s praise.
 
 

## 21.  Now in a song of grateful praise.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/199eOhmBt29RS69UF6S%2DsQUCuaaECCxXx/edit?mode=html)



    1. Now in a song of grateful praise,
    To our dear Lord the voice we’ll raise; 
    With all His saints we’ll join to tell,
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    2. All worlds His glorious power confess,
    His wisdom all His works express;
    But, O His love!—what tongue can tell? 
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    3. And since our souls have known His love, 
    What mercies hath He made us prove, 
    Mercies which all our praise excel;
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    4. Tho’ many fiery flaming darts 
    The tempter levels at our hearts,
    With this we all his rage repel,
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”

    5. And when on that bright day we rise,
    And join the anthems of the skies,
    Among the rest this note shall swell,
    “Our Jesus hath done all things well.”
 
 

## 22.  Nothing know we of the season
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IbEzej3jE3iX94ubx5n5gfP_FIe6wwC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Nothing know we of the season,
    When the world shall pass away;
    But we know the saints have reason,
    To expect a glorious day;
    When the Saviour shall return,
    And His people cease to mourn.

    2. While a careless world is sleeping—
    Then it is the Lord will come;
    While His Saints the watch are keeping, 
    That they may escape its doom—
    As admonish’d by the Word 
    Of their faithful loving Lord.

    3. O what sacred joys await them!
    They shall see the Saviour then; 
    Those who now oppose and hate them, 
    Never shall oppose again!
    Brethren, let us think of this,
    All is ours since we are His.

    4. Being of the favour’d number
    Whom the Saviour calls His own,
    ’Tis not meet that we should slumber, 
    Nothing should be left undone:
    This should be His people’s aim;
    Still to glorify His name.

    5. Waiting then, our Lord’s returning,
    Be it ours His word to keep;
    Let our lamps be always burning,
    Let us watch while others sleep,
    We’re no longer of the night,
    We are children of the light.
 
 

## 23.  '''Twixt Jesus and the chosen race.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19U48D88YsWByTUh%2D_kxsoTxUPyK7rRDe/edit?mode=html)



    1.’Twixt Jesus and the chosen race 
    Subsists a bond of sov’reign grace,
    A bond which hell’s tremendous train,
    Can ne’er dissolve, or rend in twain.

    2. This sacred bond shall never break,
    Though earth should to her centre shake; 
    We rest in hope, assur’d of this,—
    For God has pledg’d His faithfulness.

    3. He spake and sware;—and it was done, 
    Wrought in the blood of His dear Son;
    The Lamb appointed to redeem
    All that the Father lov’d in Him.

    4. O sacred union, firm and strong!
    How great the grace! how sweet the song!
    That Adam’s sons should ever be
    One with Incarnate Deity!

    5. One in His death, one when He rose,
    One when He triumph’d o’er His foes, 
    One when in heav’n He took His seat, 
    And plainly prov’d all hell’s defeat.

    6. Triumphant thus o’er all its pow’rs,
    (For all He is and has is ours),
    With Him, our Head, we stand or fall, 
    Our life, our surety and our all.

    7. Thus sav’d in Him, a chosen race
    O may we prove our faithfulness—
    And live to Him in Whom we died 
    With Whom we shall be glorified.
 
 

## 24.  'On Christ, salvation rests secure.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IohKgAZwFW58OAFUxEyGQOsXKGiunaT/edit?mode=html)



    1. On Christ, salvation rests secure;
    This Rock of Ages must endure;
    Nor can that faith be overthrown,
    Which rests upon the “Living Stone.”

    2. No other hope shall intervene:
    To Him we look, on Him we lean:
    Other foundations we disown,
    And build on Christ, the “Living Stone.”

    3. In Him, it is ordain’d to raise 
    A temple to Jehovah’s praise,
    Compos’d of all the saints, who own 
    No Saviour but the “Living Stone.”

    4. View the vast building, see it rise;
    The work how great! the plan how wise! 
    O wondrous fabric! pow’r unknown! 
    That rears it on the “Living Stone.”

    5. But most adore His precious name;
    His glory and His grace proclaim:
    For us, condemn’d, despis’d, undone,
    He gave Himself, the “Living Stone.”
 
 

## 25.  'Much in sorrow, oft in woe.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19RHWJHxloFhJ%2D04ytN%2Dahh6Nsw1kdCqX/edit?mode=html)



    1. Much in sorrow, oft in woe,
    Onward, Christians, onward go;
    Fight the fight! tho’ worn with strife,
    Battle on to life.
    Onward, Christians! onward go;
    Join the war, and face the foe;
    Faint not, little doth remain 
    Of the drear campaign.

    2. Shrink not, Christians: will you yield? 
    Will you quit the battle field?
    Shrink not, ere the fight be done.
    Ere the prize be won,
    Mail’d in armour, heav’nly bright, 
    Strong in Him, Whose grace is might, 
    Onward, Christians, onward go, 
    Conquer ev’ry foe.

    3. Fight the glorious fight of faith,
    Fear not conflict, fear not death; 
    Conflict!—that but nerves to strife: 
    Death!—to endless life!
    Onward, Christians, onward go, 
    Scorning danger, shame, and woe; 
    Tread the path which they have trod 
    Whose rest is now ~~with~~in God.

    CHORUS.
    We’re bound for the kingdom:
    Let us hasten on to glory,
    And sing Hallelujah,
    Sing glory, hallelujah!
    We’re bound for the kingdom:
    Let us onward press to glory,
    And sing Hallelujah 
    To God and the Lamb!
 
 

## 26.  'Gracious Lord, my heart is fixed'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Fv67AICl0268h4x_P9w8cFA6rkyuMN8/edit?mode=html)



    1. Gracious Lord, my heart is fixed; 
    Sing I will, and sing of Thee,
    Since the cup that justice mixed,
    Thou hast drank, and drank for me.
    Great Deliv’rer!
    Thou hast set the pris’ner free.

    2. Many were the chains that bound me,
    But the Lord has loos’d them all:
    Arms of mercy now surround me,
    Favours these, nor few nor small: 
    Saviour, keep me!
    Keep Thy servant, lest he fall.

    3. Fair the scene that lies before me;
    Life eternal Jesus gives;
    While He waves His banner o’er me,
    Peace and joy my soul receives:
    Sure His promise!
    I shall live because He lives.

    4. When the world would bid me leave Thee,
    Telling me of shame and loss,
    Saviour, guard me lest I grieve Thee,
    Lest I cease to love Thy cross:
    This is treasure;
    All the rest I count but dross.
 
 

## 27.  'Blest Lamb of God! with grateful praise.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19G87us68goTvHBKiemWNrJuYkHu4eGH7/edit?mode=html)



    1. Blest Lamb of God! with grateful praise 
    Our voices now to Thee we raise—
    On Earth to reign, redeem’d by Blood,
    We, kings and priests, are made to God.—

    2. Soon too, in glory shall we sing,
    And louder praises to Thee bring—
    While every nation, tongue and tribe, 
    Strength, glory, might,to Thee ascribe!
    Amen! Amen!
    Saviour! Amen!
 
 

## 28.  'The Saviour lives, no more to die.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BYLrKv3SsMvyALv%2DtbGn8W64F0rMOr8/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Saviour lives, no more to die;
    He lives our Head, enthron’d on high;
    He lives triumphant o’er the grave;
    He lives eternally to save.

    2. He lives to still His people’s fears;
    He lives to wipe away their tears;
    He lives their mansions to prepare;
    He lives to bring them safely there.

    3. Then let our souls in Him rejoice,
    And sing His praise with cheerful voice: 
    Our doubts and fears for ever gone,
    For Christ is on the Father’s throne.

    4. The chief of sinners He receives:
    His saints He loves, and never leaves;
    He’ll guard us safe from ev’ry ill,
    And all His promises fulfil.

    5. Abundant grace will He afford,
    Till we are present with the Lord,
    And prove what we have sung before, 
    That Jesus lives for evermore.
 
 

## 29.  Praise the Lord Who died to save us
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19%2DYaypsHnhBdM1NByiNx8C_H1_LQJFOO/edit?mode=html)



    1. Praise the Lord Who died to save us;
    Praise His name, forever dear; 
    ’Twas by Him the Father gave us 
    Eyes to see, and ears to hear:
    Praise the Saviour,
    Object of our love and fear.

    2. Grace it was, ’twas Grace abounding,
    Brought Him down to save the lost; 
    Ye above, the throne surrounding, 
    Praise Him, praise Him all His host: 
    Saints adore Him;
    Ye are they who owe Him most.

    3. Ye, of all His hand created,
    Objects are of Grace alone;
    Aliens once, but reinstated;
    Destin’d now to share His throne:
    Sing with wonder;
    Sing of what the Lord hath done.

    4. Praise His name, Who died to save us; 
    ’Tis by Him alone we live;
    And in Him the Father gave us 
    All that boundless love could give:
    Life eternal
    In our Saviour we receive.
 
 

## 30.  The atoning work is done.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/198ZLmpiI_1kIIfuAzs806GJzkxcxSSfD/edit?mode=html)



    1. ~~Th’ atoning work is done;~~ Th’ atoning work’s begun;^began,^ ^not^ ^ended^ ^on^ ^the^ ^cross^
    The victim’s blood is shed;
    And Jesus now is gone
    His people’s cause to plead:
    He stands in heav’n their great High Priest, 
    And bears their names upon His breast.

    ~~~2. He sprinkled with His blood
    The mercy-seat above;
    For Justice had withstood
    The purposes of Love;
    But Justice now withstands no more,
    And Mercy yields her boundless store.~~^Ps^ ^85:10^ ^-^ ^Justice^ ^and^ ^mercy^ ^have^ ^never^ ^been^ ^at^ ^variance^

    3. No temple made with hands
    His place of service is;
    In heav’n itself He stands,
    A heav’nly priesthood His;
    In Him the shadows of the law 
    Are all fulfill’d, and now withdraw.

    4. And though awhile He be 
    Hid from the eyes of men,
    His people look to see 
    Their great High Priest again.
    In brightest glory He will come,
    And take His waiting people home.
 
 

## 31.  'Let sinners sav''d give thanks and sing'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/162RF6%2DlWv7jcNrvg2bZDfqdOgu5O1lBl/edit?mode=html)



    1. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,*
    Of mercies past, of joys to come;
    The Lord their Saviour is, and King,
    The cross their stay, and heav’n their home.

    2. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,*
    Salvation’s theirs, and of the Lord;
    They draw from heav’n’s eternal spring,
    The living God, their great reward.

    3. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing;*
    Sweet is the subject of their song,
    Who, made the children of a King,
    Expect to sing in heav’n ere long.

    4. *Let sinners sav’d give thanks and sing,
    Whom grace has kept in dangers past; 
    And, O sweet thought! the Lord will bring 
    His people safe to heav’n at last.

    5. *Let sinners sav'd give thanks and sing,
    Of Jesus sing, through all their days;
    In heav’n their golden harps they’ll string, 
    And there for ever sing His praise.
 
 

## 32.  Great Shepherd of the chosen few
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166aU402Lqfh7RzHSDcDklro8sJ7jgY5k/edit?mode=html)



    1. Great Shepherd of the chosen few,
    Thy former mercies here renew:
    And to our waiting hearts proclaim 
    The sweetness of Thy saving name.

    2. Now may we prove the power of prayer, 
    To strengthen faith and banish care;
    To teach our faint desire to rise,
    And bring all heav’n before our eyes.
 
 

## 33.  'Awake, and sing the song.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16H%2DQCkaypQmiTE6Mr94rrHXg5yHMmDBB/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, and sing the song 
    Of Moses and the Lamb:
    Wake ev’ry heart, and ev’ry tongue,
    To praise the Saviour’s name.

    2. Sing of His dying love;
    Sing of His rising pow’r;
    Sing how He intercedes above,
    For those whose sins He bore.

    3. Sing on your heav’nly road,
    Ye sons of Glory, sing;
    To God and to the Lamb of God 
    Your cheerful praises bring.

    4. Soon shall we hear Him say,
    “Come, blessed brethren, come 
    Soon will He call us hence away, 
    And take us to His home.

    5. Then shall each raptur’d tongue
    His fullest praise proclaim,
    And sweeter voices tune the song 
    Of Moses and the Lamb.
 
 

## 34.  'Bless''d be the everlasting God.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165vlmdhwIgOIKMxXpIiCqfJrCjJOEOoE/edit?mode=html)



    1. Bless’d be ==the everlasting God,
    The Father of our Lord:==
    Let His abounding grace be prais’d!
    His majesty ador’d!

    2. When ==from the dead He rais’d His Son,==
    And took Him to the skies,
    He gave the Church a lively type 
    How she at length should rise.

    3. A type which bids us hope His grace
    Will raise us from the dust;
    And, ah! sweet thought! as Christ arose, 
    So we His members must.

    4. For tho’ we know-all shall not die,
    Yet all a change must see;
    Since when we see Him as He is,
    Then shall we like Him be.

    5. Nor death, nor life, nor earth, nor hell,
    Nor things that pass away,
    Can ever change this finish’d type,
    Or make this hope decay.

    6. The hope that we ere long shall share
    Christ’s glory and His home,
    Doth on the word of God depend 
    Till the salvation come.
 
 

## 35.  'The Lord is ris''n indeed'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15aYXVVScfct1L0_T4rCWHdKqbIWvG_CV/edit?mode=html)



    1. ~~The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    Then Justice asks no more;
    Mercy and Truth are now agreed, 
    Who stood oppos’d before.~~^Ps^ ^85:10^ ^-^ ^Justice^ ^and^ ^mercy^ ^have^ ^never^ ^been^ ^at^ ^variance^

    2. The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    Then all His work’s perform’d;
    The captive Surety now is freed,
    And Death, our foe, disarm’d.

    3. The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    He lives—to die no more;
    He lives—His people’s cause to plead, 
    Whose curse and shame He bore.

    4. The Lord is ris’n indeed:
    And Hell has lost its prey;
    And with Him all the ransom’d seed, 
    Shall reign in endless day.
 
 

## 36.  'Behold the Lamb with glory crown''d!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wq9Z1dVyivVg2eQwK7facHDZAStIyTE/edit?mode=html)



    1. Behold the Lamb, with glory crown’d!
    To Him all pow’r is giv’n:
    No place too high for Him is found,
    No place too high in heav’n.

    2. With faces veil’d, the Seraphs bright,
    Did on His glory gaze;
    Not Seraphs could endure the light,
    Of the resplendent blaze.

    3. Well may His people then be found
    Transported with the sight;
    To see their Lord with glory crown’d, 
    Must yield them sweet delight.

    4. Though high, yet He accepts the praise
    His people offer here:
    The faintest, feeblest cry they raise, 
    Will reach the Saviour’s ear.

    5. This song be ours, and this alone,
    That celebrates the name 
    Of Him that sits upon the throne 
    And that exalts the Lamb.

    6. To Him Whom men despise and slight, 
    To Him be glory given:
    The crown is His, and His by right 
    The highest place in heaven.
 
 

## 37.  'Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gjJQioODzX_GqeKDpD%2DQJ8Zw0f6pJdA/edit?mode=html)



    1. Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah!
    Pilgrims through this barren land;
    We are weak, but Thou art mighty;
    Hold us by Thy pow’rful hand.
    Bread of heaven!
    Feed us now and evermore.

    2. Open stand, Thou living Fountain!
    Whence the healing waters flow;
    Be our fiery, cloudy Pillar 
    All the dreary desert through.
    Strong Deliv’rer!
    Be Thou still our Strength and Shield.

    3. While we tread this vale of sorrow,
    May we in Thy love abide.
    Keep us, O most gracious Saviour! 
    Cleaving closely to Thy side,
    Still relying
    On The Father’s changeless love.

    4. Saviour, come, we long to see Thee, 
    Long to dwell with Thee above, 
    And to know in full communion 
    All the sweetness of Thy love.
    Come, Lord Jesus,
    Take Thy waiting people home.
 
 

## 38.  'Come, Thou fount of every blessing'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15RRSnFV1HkseED9uaGDO8orJ7euOe2yL/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
    Tune my heart to sing Thy grace: 
    Streams of mercy never ceasing 
    Call for ceaseless songs of praise.

    2. Teach me, Lord, the rapt’rous measures
    Sung by heav’nly hosts above;
    While I sing the countless treasures 
    Of my God’s unchanging love.

    3. Jesus sought me when a stranger,
    Wand’ring from the fold of God;
    He to rescue me from danger, 
    Interpos’d His precious blood.

    4. O to grace how great a debtor
    Daily I’ m constrain’d to be!
    Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
    Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee.

    5. Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
    Prone to leave the God I love:
    Yet Thou, Lord, hast deign’d to seal it, 
    With Thy Spirit from above;

    6. Rescued thus from sin and danger,
    Purchas’d by the Saviour’s blood, 
    May I walk on earth a stranger,
    As a Son and Heir of God.
 
 

## 39.  Though twice ten thousand sinners go
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15baL3xkz2pJPDqtGVzbGkTSlD0cZpfuz/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though twice ten thousand sinners go
    Down to the pit of endless woe, 
    God’s choice, from all repentance free, 
    The guard of His elect shall be.

    2. To fall from that, if God be true,
    No sinner shall whom He foreknew; 
    Whom God will save, to God must rise, 
    And fill a mansion in the skies.

    3. Triumphant grace shall ever keep,
    The weakest of the way-worn sheep, 
    Salvation’s free and shall be giv’n 
    To all who trust the God of Heaven.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Z%2DUZXjTLJ9Xwxbk4QZl%2DiPXGqJO6DtT/edit?mode=html)



    1. He lives—the great Redeemer lives! 
    What joy the blest assurance gives!
    And now, enthron’d above the skies,
    He pleads His Holy sacrifice,

    2. Thus has He met our desp’rate case,
    And giv’n us lasting joy and peace;
    The Lamb, Whose life can never end,
    At once our Sacrifice and Friend!

    3. Great Advocate, Almighty Friend,
    On Thee do all our hopes depend:
    Our cause can never, never fail,
    For Thou dost plead, and must prevail.

    4. In ev’ry dark distressing hour,
    When Sin and Satan join their pow’r, 
    Let this bless’d truth repel each dart, 
    That Jesus bears us on His heart.

    5. Away, then, sad and doubtful thoughts! 
    Above our fears, above our faults,
    His pow’rful intercessions rise,—
    And we o’ercome while Satan flies.
 
 

## 41.  'As saints we will not be dismay''d'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AupnbL%2DhN85Wx_sxQkljP1GzLhIvc99z/edit?mode=html)



    1. As saints we will not be dismay’d,
    Nor sink in hopeless fear;
    For as we ever need His aid,
    The Saviour’s ever near.

    2. This Abr’ham found: he rais’d the knife—
    God saw, and said, “Forbear!
    Yon ram shall yield its meaner life, 
    Behold the victim there.”

    3. Once David seemed Saul’s certain prey;
    But hark! the foe’s at hand;
    Saul turns his arms another way,
    To save th’ invaded land.

    4. When Jonah sunk beneath the wave,
    He thought to rise no more;
    But God prepar’d a fish to save,
    And bear him to the shore.

    5. Since proofs so plain of pow’r and grace,
    Are taught us in His word;
    To Fear or Care we’ll not give place,
    But wait upon the Lord.


    6. Wait for His seasonable aid,
    And, though it tarry, wait:
    The promise may be long delayed, 
    But cannot come too late.
 
 

## 42.  Christ shed His precious blood.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B0CrypZMgfxAURrJyNoTPjULBTD12M77/edit?mode=html)



    1. Christ shed His precious blood,
    To make us His alone;
    And wash’d in that atoning flood, 
    We are no more our own.

    2. If He His will reveal,
    Let us obey the call;
    Assur’d whate’er the flesh may feel, 
    His love deserves our all.

    3. Then let us keep in view
    His glory, as our end;
    Too much we cannot bear, or do, 
    For such a gracious Friend.

    4. And let us stand prepar’d
    In duty’s path to run;
    Nor count the greatest trials hard, 
    So that His will be done.

    5. With Jesus for our guide,
    The path is safe though rough; 
    The Promise says, “I will provide,” 
    And Faith replies, “Enough!”
 
 

## 43.  What though the accuser roar.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AfuLUMa0hiswg0nZdb%2D0n9vD7LOQKKFD/edit?mode=html)



    1. What, tho’ th’ Accuser roar
    Of ills that we have done!
    We know them well, and thousands more, 
    Jehovah findeth none.

    2. Sin, Satan, Death appear
    To harass and appal;—
    Yet since the gracious Lord is near, 
    Backward they go and fall.

    3. Before, behind, around,
    They set their fierce array,
    To fight and force us from our ground, 
    Along life’s narrow way.

    4. We meet them face to face,
    Through Jesus’ conquest blest;
    March in the triumph of His grace,
    Right onward to our rest.

    5. There in His book we bear
    More than a conq’ror’s name,
    Of soldier, son, and fellow-heir,
    Who fought and overcame.
 
 

## 44.  'His be "the Victor''s name'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUZG3hwUeubguK3J%2DfNB2BuNe59xxvhn/edit?mode=html)



    1. His be “the Victor’s name,”
    Who fought our fight alone; 
    Triumphant saints no honour claim, 
    His conquest was their own.

    2. By weakness and defeat,
    He won the meed and crown;
    Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
    By being trodden down.

    3. He Hell in hell laid low;
    Made sin, He sin o’erthrew;
    Bow’d to the grave, destroy’d it so, 
    And Death, by dying slew.

    4. Bless, bless the Conq’ror slain,
    Slain in His victory;
    Who lived, Who died, Who lives again 
    For thee, His church, for thee!
 
 

## 45.  'O gracious Shepherd! bind us'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B17Uk4TG7vXfKkhYF2BdNgp1xh7EMWV2/edit?mode=html)



    1. O gracious Shepherd! bind us
    With cords of love to Thee, 
    And evermore remind us 
    How mercy set us free.
    O may Thy holy Spirit 
    Keep this before our eyes, 
    That we Thy death and merit 
    Above all else may prize!

    2. We are of God’s salvation,
    Assured through Thy love 
    Yet, ah! on each occasion,
    How faithless do we prove. 
    Thou hast our sins forgiv’n— 
    Then leaving all behind,
    We would press on to heav’n, 
    Bearing the prize in mind.

    3. Thus may we then, Lord! ever,
    While in this vale of tears, 
    Look up to Thee, and never 
    Give way to anxious fears. 
    For Thou wilt not forsake us, 
    Though we are oft to blame; 
    O let Thy love, then, make us 
    True to Thy faith and name!
 
 

## 46.  As debtors to mercy alone
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWDJB%2D8RgoOd9F%2D1rnaf3ZiioMzQk7z6/edit?mode=html)



    1. As Debtors to mercy alone,
    Of Heavenly mercy we sing;
    Nor fear, with His righteousness on,
    Our persons and off’rings to bring:
    The wrath of a sin-hating God 
    With us can have nothing to do:
    Our Saviour’s obedience and blood 
    Hide all our transgressions from view.

    2. The work which His goodness began,
    The arm of His strength shall complete 
    His promise is Yea and Amen,
    And never was forfeited yet:
    Things future, nor things that are now, 
    Nor all things below nor above,
    Can make Him His purpose forego,
    Or sever our souls from His love.

    3. Our names, from the palms of His hands,
    Eternity will not erase;
    Impressed on His heart this remains,
    In marks of indelible grace:
    And we to the end shall endure,
    As sure as the earnest is given;
    More happy, but not more secure,
    ==The souls of the blessed in heav’n.==^sound^ ^only^ ^if^ ^it^ ^means^ ^Moses,^ ^Elijah,^ ^etc.^ ^Not^ ^the^ ^dead^
 
 

## 47.  'O joyful day! O glorious hour!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ai4GEW9Mvb2RKAdItHjdPVHjDcYTMCHU/edit?mode=html)



    1. O joyful day! O glorious hour!
    When Jesus by Almighty pow’r
    Reviv’d and left the grave;
    In all His works behold Him great,
    Before, Almighty to create,
    Almighty now to save.

    2. The first begotten from the dead,
    He’s risen now, His people’s head,
    To make their life secure;
    And if like Him they yield their breath, 
    Like Him they’ll burst the bonds of death, 
    Their resurrection’s sure.

    3. Why should His people then be sad,
    None have such reason to be glad
    As those redeem’d to God:
    Jesus, the Mighty Saviour lives,
    To them eternal life He gives,
    The purchase of His blood.

    4. Dear Brethren let our praise resound,
    And in His constant work abound,
    Whose blessed name is Love;
    Be sure our labour’s not in vain,
    For we with Jesus yet shall reign,
    With Jesus dwell above.
 
 

## 48.  'Come, Thou glorious day of promise!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGFqsclXAcTCTMkGnmPIW_XBqa_52f0D/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, Thou glorious day of promise!
    Come and spread Thy cheerful ray, 
    When the scatter’d sheep of Israel 
    Shall no longer go astray;
    When Hosannas 
    With united voice they’ll cry.

    2. Lord, how long wilt Thou be angry?
    Shall Thy wrath for ever burn?
    Rise! redeem Thine ancient people; 
    Their transgressions from them turn: 
    King of Israel!
    Come and set Thy people free.

    3. O that soon Thou wouldst to Jacob
    Thine enliv’ning Spirit send;
    Of their unbelief and mis’ry 
    Make, O Lord, a speedy end;
    Lord Messiah!
    Prince of Peace o’er Israel reign,

    4. Glory, honour, praise, and power,
    Be unto the Lamb for ever!
    Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. 
    Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
    Praise ye the Lord.
    Hallelujah! Praise the Lord.
 
 

## 49.  By whom was David taught.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AlYOQiXE1GhbWD67pd064IoviL_UHTeB/edit?mode=html)



    1. By whom was David taught 
    To aim the dreadful blow,
    When he Goliah fought,
    And laid the Gittite low?
    No sword or spear the stripling took, 
    But chose a pebble from the brook.

    2.’Twas Israel’s God and King 
    Who sent him to the fight;
    Who gave him strength to sling,
    And skill to aim aright.
    Ye feeble saints, your strength endures, 
    Because young David’s God is yours.

    3. Who order’d Gideon forth,
    To storm the invader’s camp,
    With arms of little worth,
    A pitcher’and a lamp?
    The trumpets made his coming known, 
    And all the host was overthrown.

    4. But now, while ’tis to day,
    Arm’d with the Spirit’s sword,
    God helping us to say,
    “Our trust is in the Lord,”
    The blood of Christ o’ercomes all foes, 
    Tho’ all the Hosts of Hell oppose.
 
 

## 50.  Forever blessed be the Lord
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AvsEAzeKgB%2Ddy_Mjkn70C1kh4pWhg2CA/edit?mode=html)



    1. For ever blessed be the Lord,
    Our Saviour and our shield;
    Who ==sends His Spirit with His word,==
    To arm us for the field.

    2. When Sin and Hell their force unite,
    He makes His church His care; 
    Instructs us for the heav’nly fight,
    And guards us through the war.

    3. His help against the hostile Pow’rs
    Doth our weak courage raise;
    He makes the glorious vict’ry ours 
    Then His shall be the praise.
 
 

## 51.  Let sinners boast of sinful joys.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LModpchRrxPw_WOTQu1ptrP18nA_%2DVv/edit?mode=html)



    1. Let sinners boast of sinful joys,
    The poor delights of sense;
    ’Tis Christ our inmost thoughts employs, 
    We draw our comforts thence.

    2. With sweet contentment now we bid,
    Farewell to pleasures here;
    With Christ in God our life is hid,
    And all its springs are there.

    3.’Tis now conceal’d and lodg’d secure,
    In God’s eternal Son;
    From age to age it shall endure, 
    Though to the world unknown.

    4. Then Lord, remove whate’er divides,
    Our lingering souls from Thee; 
    'Tis fit that where the Head resides,
    The members too should be.
 
 

## 52.  'Jesus only - He can give'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WPBR%2DWGSobvRSE1cIpE3%2D8U5IK8tYMc/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus only—He can give 
    Peace and comfort while we live; 
    Jesus only can supply 
    Boldness if we’re call’d to die; 
    Jesus shall our treasure be, 
    Through His own eternity:
    He is now our nearest Friend,
    And His love will never end!
 
 

## 53.  Happy they who trust in Jesus.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18BUNe%2DVwOVTU3XBJdyv_hCI5taTldX2g/edit?mode=html)



    1. Happy they who trust in Jesus;
    Sweet their portion is, and sure, 
    When the foe on others seizes,
    God will keep His own secure.
    Happy people;
    Happy, though despis’d and poor.

    2. Since His love and mercy found us,
    We are precious in His sight;
    Thousands now may fall around us, 
    Thousands more be put to flight,
    But His presence 
    Keeps us safe by day and night.

    3. Lo! our Saviour never slumbers,
    Ever watchful is His care;
    Though we cannot boast of numbers,
    In His strength secure we are.
    Sweet their portion,
    Who our Saviour’s kindness share.

    4. As the bird beneath her feathers,
    Guards the objects of her care,
    So the Lord His children gathers,
    Spreads His wings and hides them there: 
    Thus protected,
    All their foes they boldly dare.
 
 

## 54.  'Hark! ten thousand voices crying'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hbEuO%2Dqs9kn_AVK_Yrc79xAEsBHu7We/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hark! ten thousand voices crying,
    “Lamb of God!” with one accord; 
    Thousand thousand saints replying, 
    Wake at once th’ echoing chord.

    2. “Praise the Lamb,” the chorus waking,
    All in heav’n together throng;
    Loud and far each tongue partaking ,
    Rolls around the endless song.

    3. Grateful incense this, ascending
    Ever to the Father’s Throne;
    Ev’ry knee to Jesus bending,
    All the mind in heav’n is one.

    4. All the Father’s counsels claiming
    Equal honours to the Son,
    All the Son’s effulgence beaming,
    Makes the Father’s glory known.

    5. By the Spirit all pervading,
    Hosts unnumber’d round the Lamb, 
    Crown’d with light and joy unfading, 
    Hail Him as the great “I am.”

    6. Joyful now the new creation
    Rests in undisturb’d repose,
    Blest in Jesu’s full salvation,
    Sorrow now, nor thraldom knows.

    7. Hark! the heavenly notes again!
    Loudly swells the song of praise; 
    Throughout creation’s vault, Amen! 
    Amen! responsive joy doth raise.
 
 

## 55.  'Hosanna to the King of kings!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18bhCF3qxyJGKNtsAl2x6eSfzCaj8Jgts/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hosanna to the King of kings!
    The great incarnate Word!
    Ten thousand songs and glories wait 
    To crown our coming Lord.

    2. Thy vict’ries and Thy endless fame
    Through the wide world shall run;
    And everlasting ages sing
    The triumphs Thou hast won.
 
 

## 56.  'Arise, ye saints, arise'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18X0O30wHvJ0_QKJlakzZ99TMAy7zM3Lf/edit?mode=html)



    1. Arise, ye saints, arise,
    The Lord our leader is:
    The foe before His banner flies, 
    For victory is His.

    2. Behold, He leads the way!
    We’ll follow where He goes, 
    We cannot fail to win the day 
    Since He subdues our foes.

    3. Lead on, Almighty Lord,
    Lead on to victory:
    Encourag’d by the bright reward, 
    With joy we follow Thee.

    4. We follow Thee our Guide,
    Who didst salvation bring:
    We follow Thee, through grace supplied 
    From heav’n’s eternal spring.
 
 

## 57.  We hope to see the day.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18He5jzMh7t%2Dl1aS3Gv4wSKWUYDa7MMSX/edit?mode=html)



    1. We hope to see the day
    When toil and strife shall cease; 
    When we shall cast our arms away,
    And dwell in endless peace.

    2. This hope supports us here,
    It makes our burdens light;
    It serves our drooping hearts to cheer 
    Till faith shall end in sight.

    3. Till of the prize possess’d,
    We hear of war no more,
    And, O sweet thought! for ever rest, 
    On yonder peaceful shore.
 
 

## 58.  'Faint not, Christian! though the road.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18MuNoemLmA9ifXENFerzOsSQ%2DlCKBbRn/edit?mode=html)



    1. Faint not, Christian! though the road 
    Leading to thy blest abode,
    Darksome be, and dangerous too,
    Christ, thy guide, will bring thee through.

    2. Faint not, Christian! though in rage, 
    Satan doth thy soul engage;
    Take thee Faith’s anointed shield,
    Bear it to the battle field.

    3. Faint not, Christian! though the world 
    Has its hostile flag unfurl’d;
    Hold the cross of Jesus fast,
    Thou shalt overcome at last.

    4. Faint not, Christian! though within, 
    There’s a heart so prone to sin:
    Christ the Lord is over all,
    He’ll not suffer thee to fall.

    5. Faint not, Christian! though thy God 
    Smite thee with the chast’ning rod;
    Smite He must, with Father’s care,
    That He may His love declare.

    6. Faint not, Christian! Jesu’s near;
    Soon in glory He’ll appear,
    And His love will then bestow,
    Victory over ev’ry foe.

    7. Faint not, Christian! look on high,
    Hear the harpers in the sky:
    Patient wait, and thou wilt join, 
    Chanting still of love divine.
 
 

## 59.  'The saints, of Christ the portion are'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18QtyhXEuvuA8HShpFP6_dxTQYjal5tHN/edit?mode=html)



    1. The saints, of Christ the portion are,
    Redeem’d by grace, reclaim’d by pow’r; 
    His special choice and tender care,
    Own them, and guard them every hour.

    2. He guards them in a barren land,
    Beset with sins, and fears, and woes;
    He leads and guides them by His hand, 
    And keeps them safe from all their foes.
 
 

## 60.  'Jesus, we our cross have taken.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WVv7YTBWVUMg06Q5YvWRBzTIUh8SucF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, we our cross have taken,
    All to leave, and follow Thee,
    All things else for Thee forsaken,
    Thou from hence our all shalt be;
    Perish ev’ry fond ambition,
    All we’ve sought, or hoped, or known; 
    Yet how rich is our condition,
    God and heav’n are still our own.

    2. Let the world despise and leave us;
    They have left The Saviour too,
    Human hearts and looks deceive us 
    Thou art not, like them, untrue;
    And since Thou dost smile upon us,
    God of wisdom, love and might,
    Foes may hate, and friends disown us,
    In Thy love we have delight.

    3. Go then, earthly fame and treasure,
    Come, disaster, scorn, and pain;
    In Thy service, pain is pleasure—
    With Thy favour, loss is gain—
    We have call’d our God, our Father,
    We have set our hearts on Thee,
    Storms may howl, and clouds may gather, 
    All must work our liberty.

    4. Man may trouble and distress us,
    ’Twill but drive us to Thy breast;
    Life with trials hard may press us,
    Heav’n will bring us sweeter rest.
    O ’tis not in grief to harm us,
    With Thy love so full and free,
    O ’twere not in joy to charm us,
    Were that joy unmix’d with Thee.
 
 

## 61.  'Church of God, by Christ''s salvation'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/188O1%2D0ZGsoprczy%2DgbYBJRrqfxyW27F%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1. Church of God, by Christ’s salvation,
    Rise o’er sin, and fear, and care—
    Joy to find in ev’ry station,
    Something still to do or bear;
    Think what Spirit dwells within thee— 
    Think what Father’s smiles are thine— 
    Think that Jesus died to win thee—
    Bride of Christ! wilt thou repine?

    2. Haste thee on from grace to glory,
    Arm’d by faith, and wing’d by prayer, 
    Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee,
    God’s right hand shall guide thee there; 
    Soon shall close thine earthly mission, 
    Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days,
    Hope shall change to glad fruition,
    Faith to sight, and pray’r to praise.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jFmB497cFdZmHKNToA5Esw7%2DCeS7GEj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father of peace, and God of love!
    We own Thy power to save,
    That power by which our Shepherd rose 
    Victorious o’er the grave.

    2. Him from the dead Thou brought’st again
    When, by His sacred blood,
    Confirm’d and seal’d for evermore,
    Th’ eternal covenant stood.

    3. O may the Spirit guide our souls,
    And mould them to Thy will,
    That our weak hearts no more may stray, 
    But keep Thy precepts still;

    4. That to perfection’s sacred height
    We nearer still may rise;
    And all we think, and all we do,
    Be pleasing in Thine eyes!
 
 

## 63.  'Sav''d from the awful guilt of sin.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZXU_2mLq5mxl%2DkYyoKfhtStoXYOCkio/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sav’d from the awful guilt of sin,
    By Him Who bare the cross; 
    We’ll now a cheerful strain begin, 
    Where God began with us.

    2. We sing the vast unmeasur’d grace,
    Of height and depth untold! 
    Which did the saints elect embrace 
    As sheep within the fold.

    3. We had not known the blood for sin,
    Nor sweets of pard’ning love,
    Unless our worthless names had been 
    Enroll’d for life, above.

    4. This purpose of eternal love
    Did Jesus’ soul sustain;
    And earth or hell, the same to move,
    Did all conspire in vain.

    5. Well may we sing, since bought with blood
    Of the Begotten Son;
    O how secure God’s purpose stood 
    Ere time its race begun!
 
 

## 64.  'O Holy Saviour! Friend unseen'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17wkco_tOL465eIOTNh12lK_5f%2DRq2_Ch/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Holy Saviour! Friend unseen,
    Since on Thine arm Thou bid’st us lean, 
    Help us, throughout life’s changing scene,
    By faith to cling to Thee!

    2. Blest with this fellowship divine,
    Take what Thou wilt, we’ll not repine; 
    For as the branches to the vine,
    We only cling to Thee!

    3. Tho’ far from home, fatigu’d, opprest,
    Here we have found a place of rest;
    As exiles still, yet not unblest,
    Because we cling to Thee.

    4. Without a murmur we dismiss 
    Our former dreams of earthly bliss,
    Our joy, our consolation, this,
    Each hour to cling to Thee.

    5. What, though the world deceitful prove, 
    And earthly friends and hopes remove; 
    With patient uncomplaining love,
    Still can we cling to Thee.

    6. Tho’ oft we seem to tread alone
    Life’s dreary waste, with thorns o’ergrown, 
    Thy voice .of Love, in gentlest tone, 
    Whispers, “Still cling to Me.”

    7. Though faith and hope are often tried,
    We ask not, need not, aught beside;
    So safe, so calm, so satisfied,
    The souls that cling to Thee.

    8. They fear not Satan nor the Grave,
    They know Thee near and strong to save, 
    With Thee all danger they can brave,
    Because they cling to Thee.

    9. Blest is our lot whate’er befall,
    Who can affright or who appal—
    Since on Thy strength, our rock, our all, 
    Jesus! we cling to Thee.
 
 

## 65.  'With heav''n in view we tread the path'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17RktUkaMmm8NjipdhWNg1WCQcoXSs1eQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. With heav’n in view, we tread the path
    The saints of former ages trod;
    Like them, the children once of wrath, 
    But now, like Christ, the sons of God.

    2. No room for any boast have we,
    Upon another’s wealth we live; 
    The pardon we enjoy is free,
    The praise to God alone we give.

    3. We seek a city far from this,
    A distant city, out of sight;
    Our God Himself its builder is,
    The Lamb, its everlasting light.

    4. And sad to us the way appears,
    Till we our Lord and God can see: 
    Yet tho’ while here we sow in tears,
    Our harvest hence ere long shall be.

    5. And yet to us full joy there is,
    In Him Who is the joy of heav’n;
    And blest our lot! for we are His! 
    Opposers once, but now forgiv’n.

    6. Our aim be this, to live below,
    As He would have His people live: 
    To those who own and serve Him so, 
    The Lord a bright reward will give.
 
 

## 66.  The Church in her militant state.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yX_R9YXxLifmz5eZiZvxyZg40s0zCuz/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Church in her militant state
    Is weary, and cannot forbear;
    The saints, with desire still wait,
    To see Him again in the air!

    2. The Spirit invites in the bride,
    Her Heav’nly Lord to descend; 
    And place her, enthron’d at His side, 
    In glory that never shall end.

    3. The news of His coming I hear,
    And gladly I join in the cry,
    O Jesus in triumph appear,
    Appear on the clouds of the sky!

    4. Come Lord to the Bride of Thy love,
    In fulness of majesty come;
    And give me the mansion above, 
    Prepar’d in Thy heavenly home!
 
 

## 67.  'Jerusalem ! our heav''nly home.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/180rGpjJSVHdy0w75SWlJYYQxlomstuDI/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jerusalem! our heav’nly home
    (Name to us ever dear),
    When will the Saviour come, and thou 
    To us, His Saints, appear?

    2. When shall these eyes thy jasper walls
    And gates of pearl survey;
    Thy fabric rear’d on precious stones, 
    Of ev’ry brilliant ray.

    3. Transparent as the crystal glass,
    And form’d of purest gold; 
    Perfection’s height art thou, of all 
    That man can e’er behold.

    4. In thee, the myriads of the saints
    Shall in one song unite,
    And each the bliss of all shall see 
    With infinite delight.

    5. O when, thou city of our God,
    Shalt thou for us descend;
    And our eternal sabbath come 
    When praise shall never end?
 
 

## 68.  'Jerusalem! our happy home'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Z3AIgTK8u98mTlWmf2LSSRF3JVB2ju4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jerusalem! our happy home,
    Our souls still sigh for thee,
    Till all our conflicts here are past,
    And we Thy glory see.

    2. Why should we shrink at pain or woe,
    Or feel at death dismay?
    Thy matchless glory is in view 
    And realms of endless day.

    3. Apostles, martyrs, saints, shall meet
    In Thee (a ransom’d band);
    And all who follow Jesus here,
    Around Him there shall stand.

    4. Then shall His servants serve the Lord,
    From sin and sorrow free;
    Blest home! thro’ rude and stormy scenes 
    Onward we press to thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lI2wJs4coWyxlyBtMSZ_F%2D4x85Eui4C/edit?mode=html)



    1. Soon all shall hail our Jesus’ name,
    Angels shall prostrate fall,
    For Him the brightest glory claim,
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    2. The risen saints shall sound the lyre,
    And, as they sound it, fall 
    Before His face Who formed their choir, 
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    3. The remnant sav’d from Israel’s race,
    Redeem’d from Israel’s fall,
    Shall praise Him for His wondrous grace, 
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    4. Gentiles shall come—and every king
    Throughout this earthly ball,
    To Zion come—and tribute bring,
    And hail Him Lord of all.

    5. In Heaven—on earth—shall happy throngs
    In wond’ring rapture fall,
    And join in everlasting songs,
    To hail Him Lord of all.
 
 

## 70.  'Jesus, the Lord, is risen'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/181UfVVpmDsY9jfa4F0Ea3ova6313d4b3/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, the Lord, is ris’n
    Triumphant o’er the grave;
    For us He burst the pris’n,
    Almighty now to save:
    Captivity is captive led,
    Since Jesus liveth that was dead.

    2. Who to our charge shall lay
    Iniquity or guilt?
    All sin is done away,
    Since Jesus’ blood was spilt.
    Captivity, &c. 

    3. Who now accuseth them
    Whom God hath justified?
    Or who shall those condemn,
    For whom the Surety died?
    Captivity, &c.

    4. Christ hath the ransom paid,
    The glorious work is done;
    On Him our help is laid,
    The victory is won.
    Captivity, &c.
 
 

## 71.  'O blessed Saviour, is Thy love'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13liL0MCx4rvdlyNWwA1G5TZPwSgfhCp7/edit?mode=html)



    1. O blessed Saviour, is Thy love
    So great! so full! so free!
    Behold! we give our thoughts, our hearts, 
    Our lives, our all to Thee.

    2. We love Thee for the glorious worth
    Which in Thyself we see:
    We love Thee for that shameful cross, 
    Endur’d so patiently.

    3. No man of greater love can boast
    Than for his friend to die;
    Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!
    What love with Thine can vie?

    4. Though in the very form of God,
    With heav’nly glory crown’d,
    Thou didst partake of human flesh,
    Beset with sorrow round.

    5. Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
    In ev’ry thing but sin;
    That we as like Thee might become,
    As we unlike had been.

    6. Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,
    In ev’ry beauteous grace;
    From glory into glory chang’d,
    ’Till we behold Thy face.

    7. O Lord! we treasure in our souls
    The mem’ry of Thy love;
    And ever shall Thy name to us 
    A grateful odour prove.
 
 

## 72.  The saint amid this stormy world
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/146RwfbYFsB_sSb77%2DNB6S7sqt9EVRR9h/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Saint amid this stormy world,
    Is like the flutter’d dove,
    And fain would be as swift of wing,
    To flee to Him we love.

    2. The cords that bound our hearts to earth
    Are loos’d by Jesus’ hand,
    Before His cross we now are left,
    As strangers in the land.

    3. That visage marr’d, those sorrows deep,
    The thorns, the scourge, the gall, 
    These were the golden chains of love, 
    His captives to enthral.

    4. Our hearts are with Him on the throne,
    And ill can brook delay,
    Each moment longing for that word,
    “Rise up and come away.”
 
 

## 73.  'With hope deferr''d, oft faint and sick'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bIow80rWZpUpELdg3lS6YJZDwljJTCb/edit?mode=html)



    1. With hope deferr’d, oft faint and sick,
    “Why tarries Christ?” we cry;
    And if He should rebuke our haste, 
    Thus would we make reply;—

    2. “May not the exile, Lord, desire
    Her own sweet realm to see?
    May not the captive seek release?
    The pris’ner to be free?

    3. “Children, when far away, may long
    For home and kindred dear,
    And she that loves her absent Lord, 
    Must grieve till He appear.”
 
 

## 74.  'Fain would we, Jesus, know Thy love.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13td7FrPPtcv4BECQObIZ_Dbs7ELdiJOx/edit?mode=html)



    1. Fain would we, Jesus, know Thy love 
    Which yet no measure knows;
    Would search the depth of all Thy wounds, 
    The secret of Thy woes.

    2. Fain would we strike the golden harp,
    And wear the promis’d crown,
    And, at Thy feet while bending low,
    Would sing what Grace has done.

    3. Then leave us not in this dark world,
    As strangers long to roam,
    Come, Lord, and take us to Thyself,
    Come, Jesus, quickly come!
 
 

## 75.  'Soldiers of Christ, arise'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wFG96pzt7KdZucmluoXoc6HABVjDBqp/edit?mode=html)



    1. Soldiers of Christ, arise,
    And put your armour on—
    Strong in the strength which God supplies 
    Through His eternal Son.

    2. Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
    And in His mighty pow’r—
    Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
    Is more than conqueror.

    3. Stand in His heav’nly might,
    With all His strength endu’d,
    But take, to arm you for the fight,
    The panoply of God.

    4. That having all things done,
    And all your conflicts past,
    Ye may o’ercome, through Christ alone, 
    And stand complete at last.
 
 

## 76.  'Come on, my partners in distress.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HJ6%2DwCPVHLIG1im_YqjwH0jylgVqYuL/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come on, my partners in distress,
    My comrades thro’ the wilderness,
    Who still your sorrows feel;
    Awhile forget your griefs and fears, 
    And look beyond this vale of tears,
    To that celestial hill.

    2. Look forward to that happy place, 
    Beyond the bounds of time and space,
    The Saints’ secure abode;
    On faith’s strong eagle pinions rise, 
    And force your passage to the skies, 
    And scale the mount of God.

    3. See where the Lamb in glory stands, 
    Encircled by His radiant bands,
    And join the angelic pow’rs;
    For all that height of glorious bliss 
    Our everlasting portion is,
    And all that heav’n is ours.

    4. Who suffer with their Master here,
    Shall soon before His face appear,
    And at His side sit down;
    To patient faith the prize is sure,
    And all who to the end endure 
    The cross, shall wear the crown.

    5. Thrice blessed, joy-inspiring hope,
    It lifts the fainting spirit up,
    It brings to life the dead;
    Our conflicts here shall soon be past, 
    And we shall all ascend at last, 
    Triumphant with our Head.
 
 

## 77.  'Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Cs544BzbNv81KUBrHX0I_s%2DImlNspb_/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness 
    Our beauty are, our glorious dress; 
    Midst flaming worlds, in these array’d 
    With joy shall we lift up the head.

    2. Bold shall we stand in that great day, 
    For who aught to our charge shall lay, 
    While by Thy blood absolv’d we are 
    From sin’s tremendous curse and fear?

    3. Thus Abraham, the friend of God,
    Thus all the saints redeem’d with blood,
    Saviour of sinners Thee proclaim 
    And all their boast is in Thy name.

    4. This spotless robe the same appears, 
    When ruin’d nature sinks in years,
    No age can change its glorious hue,
    The robe of Christ is ever new.

    5. Then let the dead now hear Thy voice, 
    And bid Thy chosen ones rejoice,
    Their beauty this, their glorious dress, 
    Jesus, the Lord our righteousness.
 
 

## 78.  With joy we meditate the grace.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Atz7Tqy_0BfYnYaiEw6srhPb6ecpmZK/edit?mode=html)



    1. With joy we meditate the grace
    Of our High Priest above;
    His heart is fill’d with tenderness,
    His very name is Love.

    2. Touch’d with a sympathy within,
    He knows our feeble frame;
    He knows what sore temptations mean, 
    For He has felt the same.

    3. But spotless, innocent, and pure,
    The great Redeemer stood,
    While Satan’s fiery darts He bore,
    And did resist to blood.

    4. He, in the days of feeble flesh,
    Pour’d out His cries and tears 
    And in His measure feels afresh 
    What ev’ry member bears.

    5. Then boldly let our faith address
    His mercy and His pow’r;
    We shall obtain deliv’ring grace 
    In each distressing hour.
 
 

## 79.  'Children of the heav''nly King'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/143B_I8OXHEs8vV4ZdqjvR1JTks6l4S0P/edit?mode=html)



    1. Children of the heav’nly King,
    As ye journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing the Saviour’s worthy praise, 
    Glorious in His works and ways.

    2. Ye are traveling home to God 
    In the way the fathers trod;
    Soon, the dead in Christ, and ye 
    "With the Lord shall ever be.”

    3. Shout, ye ransom’d flock and blest, 
    Ye on Jesus’ throne shall rest; 
    There your seat is now prepar’d, 
    There your kingdom and reward.

    4. Fear not, though a feeble band, 
    Mid the conflict boldly stand:
    Jesus Christ, God’s own dear Son, 
    Bids you undismay’d go on.

    5. Lord, submissively we go,
    Gladly leaving all below;
    Only Thou our Leader be,
    And we still will follow Thee.
 
 

## 80.  'Now begin the heav''nly theme'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14L2mo%2DiWTxTEUoMmcTLqCZe9Yh%2D8qQ7W/edit?mode=html)



    1. Now begin the heav’nly theme, 
    Sing aloud in Jesus’ name:
    Ye, who His salvation prove, 
    Triumph in Redeeming Love.

    2. Ye, who see the Father’s grace 
    Beaming in the Saviour’s face,
    As to Glory on ye move,
    Praise and bless Redeeming Love.

    3. Mourning souls, dry up your tears, 
    Banish all your guilty fears,
    See your guilt and curse remove 
    Cancell’d by Redeeming Love!

    4. Welcome, all by sin oppress’d, 
    Welcome to His sacred rest:
    Nothing brought Him from above, 
    Nothing—but Redeeming Love.

    5. He subdu’d th’ infernal pow’rs,
    Those tremendous foes of ours,
    From their boasted empire drove, 
    Mighty in Redeeming Love.

    6. Hither; then, your praises bring,
    And of Jesus gladly sing;
    Gladly join the hosts above,
    Join to praise Redeeming Love.
 
 

## 81.  'Arm of the Lordawake, awake!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19eBm1VevRnOx0XIkMyJoMWgANzr4V5Xg/edit?mode=html)



    1. Arm of the Lord—awake, awake!
    The yoke of Judah’s bondage break;
    Tear from her captive neck the chain,
    And raise her from the dust again.

    2. Awake— as in the days of old,
    Bring back the wand’rers to Thy fold.
    Shall Israel’s sons forever rove
    Far from the house and land they love?

    3. O no! before our gladd’ning eyes,
    We see the Star of Jacob rise;
    The fulness of the isles doth come,
    Leading the exil’d people home!

    4. They come, they come, on every side,
    To Zion bend, a whelming tide;
    To Zion bend—no more to stray:
    The veil, the veil is torn away!

    5. Peace round them now, where’er they go, 
    Shall like a deep’ning river flow;
    The conqueror shall conquer’d be,
    And captive led captivity.
 
 

## 82.  'Come, ye that love the Lord.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7W3KtipilH9HhjV7c6cx4y6dfbizhGZ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, ye that love the Lord,
    And let your joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus approach the throne.

    2. Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God;
    But children should their praises bring, 
    And speak their joys abroad.

    3. The God who rules on high,
    And all the earth surveys;
    Who rides upon the stormy sky,
    And calms the roaring seas;

    4. This glorious God is ours—
    A God of boundless love!
    And soon He’ll send His heav’nly pow’rs 
    To carry us above.

    5. There we shall see His face,
    And never, never sin;
    There from the fountain of His grace 
    Drink endless pleasures in.

    6. And now, until we rise
    To that immortal state,
    The thoughts of such amazing bliss
    Should constant joy create.
 
 

## 83.  'Master! we would no longer be.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARxagx3aBcyDXw0G0WxmN%2DQwxX0yxoB9/edit?mode=html)



    1. Master! we would no longer be 
    Lov’d by the world that hated Thee,
    But patient in Thy footsteps go,
    Thy sorrow as Thy joy to know,
    We would—and O bestow the pow’r— 
    With meekness meet the darkest hour, 
    By shame, contempt, however tried,
    For Thou wast scorn’d and crucified.

    2. We welcome still Thy faithful word—
    “The cross shall meet its sure reward;” 
    For soon must pass the “little while,” 
    When joy shall crown Thy servants’ toil:
    When we shall hear Thee, Saviour, say 
    “Arise, my love, and come away;
    Look up, for thou shalt weep no more,
    But rest on heaven’s eternal shore.”
 
 

## 84.  'Jesus, in Thee our eyes behold.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFmc_6nCPhlAg3Nj%2D2OgEupgix15zMsC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, in Thee our eyes behold
    A thousand glories more 
    Than the rich gems and polish’d gold,
    The sons of Aaron wore.

    2. They, first, their own sin-offering brought,
    To purge themselves from sin;
    Thy life was pure without a spot,
    And all Thy nature clean.

    3. Fresh blood, as constant as the day,
    Was on their altars spilt;
    But Thy one offering took away 
    For ever all our guilt.

    4. Thoji, great Melchizedec! shalt reign,
    In peace, on Zion’s hill,
    (Thyself the Lamb that once was slain), 
    And bear Thy priesthood still.

    5. Till then for us to intercede
    Before the Father’s face,
    Be this Thy work, and ours to plead, 
    Thy merits and His grace.
 
 

## 85.  'Fly, ye seasons, fly still faster.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARyuq45h5FT9efHxojkqPJKHPeWeVdUy/edit?mode=html)



    1. Fly, ye seasons, fly still faster,
    Let the glorious day come on,
    When we shall behold our Master 
    Seated on His heav’nly throne;
    When the Saviour 
    Shall descend to claim His own.

    2. What is earth, with all its treasures,
    To the joy the Gospel brings?
    Well may we resign its pleasures, 
    Jesus brings us better things;
    All His people
    Draw from heav’n’s eternal springs.

    3. Fly, ye seasons, fly still faster,
    Swiftly bring the glorious day; 
    Jesus, come, our Lord and Master, 
    Come from heav’n without delay, 
    Take Thy people,
    Take, O take them hence away.
 
 

## 86.  The night is wearing fast away.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yHa_p4UDWPNPwLoMe1ODhJOb33fHayK/edit?mode=html)



    1. The night is wearing fast away,
    The day of glory’s dawning;
    When Christ shall all His grace display,
    The fair Millennial morning.

    2. Gloomy and dark the night has been,
    And long the way, and dreary,
    And sad each faithful saint is seen,
    And faint, and worn, and weary.

    3. Ye mourning pilgrims! dry your tears,
    And hush each sigh of sorrow;
    The light of that bright morn appears,
    The long sabbatic morrow.

    4. Lift up your heads—behold from far
    A flood of splendour streaming,
    It is the bright and morning Star,
    In living lustre beaming.

    5. And see that star-like host around
    Of angel-bands attending:
    Hark! h ark! the trumpet’s gladd’ning sound 
    ’Mid shouts triumphant blending.
 
 

## 87.  'O weeping Spouse, arise, rejoice!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lcYDqJRYbz8yn7CJcL9M5Cq_LQ_iOpi/edit?mode=html)



    1. O weeping Spouse, arise! rejoice!
    Put off thy weeds of mourning,
    And hail the Bridegroom’s welcome voice, 
    In triumph now returning.

    2. He comes! the Bridegroom promis’d long;
    Go forth with joy to meet Him;
    And raise the new and nuptial song,
    In cheerful strains to greet Him.

    3. Adorn thyself, the feast prepare
    With hallelujahs swelling;
    He comes, with thee all joys to share,
    And make this earth His dwelling. ~This~ ~takes~ ~place~ ~after~ ~the~ ~millenium~
 
 

## 88.  Why should I fear the darkest hour
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARG7zI6UhKuHfo2y7kXSb5tGhZfpoCGQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Why should I fear the darkest hour,
    Or tremble at the tempter’s pow’r?
    Jesus vouchsafes to be my tow’r.

    2. Though hot the fight, why quit the field? 
    Why should I either flee or yield,
    Since Jesus is my mighty shield?

    3. I know not what may soon betide,
    Or how my wants shall be supplied;
    But Jesus knows, and will provide.

    4. Though sin would fill me with distress,
    The throne of grace I can address,
    For Jesus is my righteousness.

    5. Though faint my prayers, and cold my love. 
    My stedfast hope shall not remove 
    While Jesus intercedes above.

    6. Against me earth and hell combine;
    But on my side is pow’r divine:
    Jesus is all, and He is mine.
 
 

## 89.  Not all the blood of beasts
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ANK1lM%2DfRTizWvihwhpTd3U8BEzJJxZ5/edit?mode=html)



    1. Not all the blood of beasts,
    On Jewish altars slain,
    Could give the guilty conscience peace,
    Or wash away its stain.

    2. But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
    Took all our sins away,—
    A sacrifice of nobler name,
    And richer blood than they.

    3. By faith I lay my hand
    On that dear head of Thine,
    While like a penitent I stand,
    And there confess my sin.

    4. My soul looks back to see
    The burden Thou didst bear,
    When hanging on th’ accursed tree,
    For all my guilt was there.

    5. Believing, I rejoice
    To see the curse remove;
    And bless the Lamb with cheerful voice, 
    And sing Redeeming Love.
 
 

## 90.  To see the Saviour as He is.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pD6A%2DPParHBDhETfTZgwTElD6lNCsCr/edit?mode=html)



    1. To see the Saviour as He is,
    What can we look for more than this? 
    Of heav’n ’tis all His people know,
    No more is needful here below.

    2. A paradise let others feign,
    Where all their fav’rite good obtain, 
    Where, free from all restraint and fear, 
    They feast on joys but tasted here.

    3. We ask no other heav’n than this,
    To see the Saviour as He is,
    To take our place upon His throne,
    And know, as we ourselves are known.

    4. Where Jesus is, ’tis heav’n to be,
    'Tis heav’n the Saviour’s face to see; 
    We know, tho’ all the world revile, 
    Celestial joy is in His smile.

    5. The little that on earth we know, 
    Makes us impatient hence to go,
    To rise from earth to heav’n above, 
    And see the object of our love.
 
 

## 91.  'In Jesus, the Lamb'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QJTZGwwT9YJncioE0Ncc%2D9eumTq%2DF8T/edit?mode=html)



    1. In Jesus, the Lamb
    (The Father’s delight,)
    The Saints without blame, 
    Appear in God’s sight;
    And while He in Jesus 
    Our souls shall approve,—
    So long shall our Father 
    Continue His love.

    2. In Jesus, free grace
    All blessings secures;
    We know and rejoice 
    That all things are ours;
    And God from His purpose 
    Will never remove,
    But love us, and bless us,
    “And rest in His love.”
 
 

## 92.  'Hark, the notes of angels singing.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Ix0C1cjCDly8AwK0kTkqAd6pQfr02KF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hark, the notes of angels singing— 
    Glory, glory to the Lamb!
    All in heav’n their tribute bringing,
    Raising high the Saviour’s name.

    2. Ye for whom His life was given,
    Sacred themes to you belong,
    Come, assist the choir of heaven,
    Join the everlasting song.

    3. See the Father hath enthron’d Him,
    At His own right hand on high:
    There the heav’nly Hosts have own’d Him, 
    Filling with His praise the sky.

    4. Fill’d with holy emulation
    Let us vie with those above,
    Sweet the theme—a free salvation,
    Fruit of everlasting love.

    5. Endless life in Him possessing,
    Let us praise His glorious name,
    Glory, honour, pow’r and blessing,
    Be forever to the Lamb!
 
 

## 93.  'Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Eb6aPBglsraUbUf6Zv7SM5GmoeJTZXf/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes, 
    And raise your voices high;
    Extol the sov’reign love, that shews 
    Our full redemption nigh.

    2. Fast on the wings of time it flies;
    Its coming nought can stay:
    It speeds with each revolving year,
    With each declining day.

    3. Not many years their rounds shall run,
    Nor many morns shall rise,
    Ere all its glories stand reveal’d 
    To our admiring eyes.

    4. Then let the wheels of nature roll
    Yet onward to decay;
    We long to hail the rising sun 
    That brings th’ eternal day.
 
 

## 94.  'Jesus! and shall it ever be'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16K%2DPX8LFaqV2_ecy1ZS7krei02yA9OCd/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus! and shall it ever be,
    A mortal man asham’d of Thee!
    Asham’d of Thee, Whom angels praise; 
    Whose glories shine through endless days

    2. Asham’d of Jesus! did not He 
    Give His own life to ransom me;
    And shed the beams of life divine,
    O’er this benighted soul of mine?

    3. Asham’d of Jesus! that dear Friend,
    On Whom my hopes of heav’n depend!
    No! when I blush—be this my shame, 
    That I no more revere His name.

    4. Asham’d of Jesus! yes, I may,
    When I’ve no guilt to wash away,
    No tear to wipe, no good to crave,
    No fears to quell, no soul to save.

    5.’Till then—nor is my boasting vain— 
    ’Till then I boast a Saviour slain!
    And O may this my glory be,
    That Christ is not asham’d of me!
 
 

## 95.  'When Israel, by divine command'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OGR1l_RrLa6u8%2Dm%2DkOXiVl20KNA3p3S/edit?mode=html)



    1. When Israel, by divine command,
    The pathless desert trod,
    They found, throughout the barren land, 
    A sure resource in God.

    2. A cloudy pillar mark’d the road,
    And screen’d them from the heat; 
    From the hard rock the water flow’d, 
    And manna was their meat.

    3. Like them, we have a rest in view,
    Secure from hostile Pow’rs;
    Like them, we pass a desert too,
    But Israel’s God is ours.

    4. His word a light before us spreads,
    By which our path we see;
    His love, a banner o’er our heads,
    From harm preserves us free.

    5. Jesus, the bread of life, is giv’n
    To be our daily food;
    Himself the wond’rous stream of heav’n, 
    The precious grace of God.

    6. Lord, ’tis enough, we ask no more;
    Thy grace around us pours 
    Its rich and unexhausted store,
    And all its joy is ours.
 
 

## 96.  'Jesus our Head, once crown''d with thorns.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ngb3SEGmU%2DZXstvRyADQJT%2Dx3dysO7F/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, our Head, once crown’d with thorns,
    Is crown’d with glory now;
    Heaven’s royal diadem adorns 
    The mighty Victor’s brow.

    2. Delight of all who dwell above,
    The joy of saints below,
    To us still manifest Thy love,
    That we its depths may know

    3. To us Thy cross with all its shame,
    With all its grace be giv’n;
    Though earth disowns Thy lowly name, 
    All worship it in heav’n.

    4. Who suffer with Thee, Lord, below,
    Shall reign with Thee above;
    Then let it be our joy to know 
    This way of peace and love.

    5. To us Thy cross is life and health,
    Though shame and death to Thee; 
    Our present glory, joy, and wealth,
    Our everlasting stay.
 
 

## 97.  'Yes, we hope the day is nigh'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vH4yBX%2DU4qC8sbmSoaw05d9Iie67GdP/edit?mode=html)



    1. Yes, we hope the day is nigh
    When many nations long enslaved, 
    Shall break forth, and sing with joy,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”

    2. Abrah’m’s seed, cast off so long,
    Shall then appear among the saved, 
    Shall arise and join the song,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”

    3. Jews and Gentiles shall unite,
    By Satan’s pow’r no more enslaved,
    And shall sing with great delight,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”

    4. Brighter glory still is nigh,
    For Jesus shall collect His saved;
    Men and angels then shall cry,
    “Hosanna to the Son of David.”
 
 

## 98.  'Come, saints, your grateful voices raise.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vhxz1NUAEhrYKNUL0XnjX3CDyKpwc00/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, saints, your grateful voices raise,
    The heav’nly Lamb adore;
    Dwell on His everlasting love,
    And praise Him evermore.

    2. Spread His dear name through all the earth,
    Sing His eternal pow’r:
    Shout the rich fountain of His blood,
    And praise Him evermore.

    3. His mercy Who our ransom paid,
    And all our sorrows bore,
    Sing with a note of loftiest joy,
    And praise Him evermore.

    4. Soon shall the Lord appear to reign,
    Then all from shore to shore 
    Shall view the glory of the Lamb 
    And praise Him evermore.
 
 

## 99.  Are we the soldiers of the cross.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16dBz4qYlw1KX7JwKcuB48aDDerlaSWwS/edit?mode=html)



    1. Are we the soldiers of the cross,
    The follow’rs of the Lamb?
    And shall we fear to own His cause,
    Or blush to speak His name?

    2. Now must we fight, if we would reign;
    Increase our courage, Lord!
    We’ll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
    Supported by Thy word.

    3. Thy saints, in all this glorious war,
    Shall conquer though they’re slain, 
    They see the triumph from afar,
    For they with Thee shall reign.

    4. Soon that desired morn shall rise,
    And all its beauties shine,
    And one bless’d song shall rend the skies: 
    “The glory, Lord, be Thine!”
 
 

## 100.  'Forever with the Lord!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/158Pdyx_Ti7dw8i833wXvyIP7z_Rhi9WK/edit?mode=html)



1\. "Forever with the Lord!"\
Amen, so let it be:\
Life from the dead is in that word,\
'Tis immortality.\
\
2. Here in the body pent,\
Absent from Him I roam,\
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent,\
A day's march nearer home.\
\
3. My Father's house on high,\
Home! to my soul how dear;\
I long to see thee, and I sigh\
Within thee to appear!\
\
4. My thirsty spirit faints\
To reach the home I love;\
The bright inheritance of saints,\
Jerusalem above.\
\
5. And though there intervene\
Rough roads and stormy skies,\
Faith will not suffer ought to screen,\
Thy glory from mine eyes.\
\
6. There shall all clouds depart,\
The wilderness shall cease;\
And sweetly shall each gladd'ned heart,\
Enjoy eternal peace.
 
 

## 101.  'While waiting for the Lord!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1teccatDQym6oh%2Dh%2Dl28R8AukB6x2UUZh/edit?mode=html)



    1. While waiting for the Lord!
    (Mid foes and darkness still)
    Truth, light and grace beam from the word, 
    My soul with joy to fill.

    2. A Father’s gracious hand,
    Whose love can never fail,
    Upholds, sustains, and makes me stand, 
    Whatever foes assail.

    3. For Jesus, by His death
    Hath rent the veil in twain,
    That while I draw this fleeting breath,
    I might this blessing gain.

    4. Till known as I am known,
    Then still this grace afford;
    Till I repeat before the throne ,
    “For ever with the Lord.”
 
 

## 102.  Though in a foreign land
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1td8_AfLXUHmZe9W_BODDhjbEd5wdwSm7/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though in a foreign land,
    We are not far from hom e;
    And nearer to our rest above,
    We ev’ry moment come,

    2. Secure within the veil,
    Christ is our anchor strong;
    While pow’r supreme, and love divine, 
    Still guide us safe along.103

    3. And should the surges rise—
    Should sore afflictions come—
    Blest is the sorrow, kind the storm, 
    That brings us nearer home.

    4. God’s grace will to the end
    Clearer and brighter shine;
    Nor present things, nor things to come, 
    Can change His love divine.

    5. Soon shall our pains and fears
    For ever pass away;
    For we shall soon the Saviour see 
    In everlasting day.
 
 

## 103.  Shepherd of the chosen number.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkLtk4%2DBjLSvswsShLPDArChZ8%2Dm1muF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Shepherd of the chosen number,
    They are safe whom Thou dost keep; 
    Other shepherds faint and slumber,
    And forget to guard the sheep.
    Watchful Shepherd!
    Thou dost wake while others sleep.

    2. When the Shepherd’s life was needful,
    Or the sheep must else be lost,
    Not of Thine own safety heedful,
    But of their’s alone, Thou wast:
    Thou didst save them;
    But no tongue can tell the co st!
 
 

## 104.  'Glory unto Jesus be!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCQmGvwYH0dI1SwDJgKNoU0BXLL%2DQlVC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Glory unto Jesus be!
    From the curse Who set us free;
    All our guilt on Him was laid,
    He the ransom fully paid.

    2. All His blessed work is done,
    God’s well pleased in His Son,
    For He rais’d Him from the dead,
    Set Him over all as Head.

    3. All should sing His work and worth,
    All above, and all on earth,
    As they sing around the throne,
    "Thou art worthy, Thou alone.”

    4. Ye who love Him, cease to mourn,
    He will certainly return,
    AH His saints with Him shall reign,— 
    "Come, Lord Jesus, come! Amen.”
 
 

## 105.  Grace is the sweetest sound.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCLvmgQXYJKB8zrEblhkhLvEq6PWwivz/edit?mode=html)



    1. Grace is the sweetest sound 
    That ever reach’d our ears!
    When conscience charg’d and justice frown’d, 
    ’Twas grace remov’d our fears.
    H106

    2.’Tis freedom to the slave,
    ’Tis light and liberty;
    It takes its terror from the grave,
    From death its victory.

    3. Grace is a mine of wealth
    Laid open to the p oor;
    Grace is the sov’reign spring of health;
    ’Tis Life for evermore.

    4. This grace then let us sing!
    (O joyful, wondrous them e!)
    Who grace has brought, shall glory bring, 
    And we shall reign with Him.

    5. Then shall we see His face
    With all the saints above,
    And sing for ever of His grace,
    For ever of His love.
 
 

## 106.  The King of kings and Lord of lords.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tvwmSGE1jmHUGxzi7%2DXNiJaa76_BMR7G/edit?mode=html)



    1. The King of kings and Lord of lords 
    Shall soon with clouds descend,
    And the last trumpet’s awful voice 
    The heav’ns and earth shall rend.

    2. Then they who live shall changed be,
    And they who sleep shall wake; 
    The grave shall yield its prisoners,
    And earth’s foundations shake.

    3. The saints of God, from death set free,
    With joy shall mount on high;
    The Lord is come—and gladly they 
    Shall meet Him in the sky.

    4. Together to their Father’s house,
    With joyful hearts they go;
    And dwell for ever with the Lamb, 
    Beyond the reach of woe.

    5. A few short years of evil past,
    We reach the happy shore,
    Where death-divided friends at last 
    Shall meet, to part no more.
 
 

## 107.  'Away with our sorrow and fear!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4Q9swuqtnw2ckoY5mD7EYF83ZQWDjhX/edit?mode=html)



    1. Away with our sorrow and fear!
    We soon shall have enter’d our home; 
    The city of saints shall appear,
    The day of eternity come!108
    From earth we shall quickly remove,
    To dwell in our proper abode,
    In mansions of glory above—
    Prepar’d of our Father and God.

    2. And now, of His grace we receive,
    By faith in His own blessed word,
    ’Mid the throne in His glory to live—
    As we died in the death of our Lord.
    These riches, conferr’d by His grace,
    Shed holy affection around;
    That all, full of love and of praise,
    May gladly in service abound!
 
 

## 108.  How can we sink with such a prop.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uDk3P9znVAOOpL06RWcaifEB2%2DX9Nfpm/edit?mode=html)



    1. How can we sink with such a prop
    As the eternal God,
    Who bears the earth’s huge pillars up,
    And spread the heav’ns abroad.

    2. How can we die while Jesus lives,
    As risen from the dead?
    Since life and grace the church receives,
    In her exalted Head.

    3. All that we are, and all we have,
    Shall be for ever Thine;
    And all a duteous heart would give, 
    Our cheerful hands resign.

    4. For if we might make some reserve, 
    And duty did not call,
    Thou lov’st us, Lord, with such a love, 
    That we would give Thee all.
 
 

## 109.  'When, gracious Lord, when shall it be.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u32dJjISt8OXOIJuaA8O3FePpZlehSTM/edit?mode=html)



    1. When, gracious Lord, when shall it be, 
    That the Espous’d Thyself shall see, 
    The fulness of Thy promise prove,
    The joys at Thy right hand above!

    2. Thee, only Thee, we fain would find, 
    And leave this world and self behind; 
    Thou, only Thou, to us be given,
    ’Tis all we ask in earth or heaven!
 
 

## 110.  'Awake, ye saints, stretch ev''ry nerve.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txFDBmlj6zg7z0CaRmZ6DNZqJnlf3paK/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, ye saints, stretch ev’ry nerve,
    And press with vigour o n;
    A heav’nly race demands our zeal,
    And an immortal crown!

    2. What clouds of witnesses unseen
    Encompass us around;Ill
    Men, once, like us, with sufFring tried, 
    Now resting till they’re crown’d!

    3. Behold a Witness nobler still,
    Affliction’s path Who tr od;
    Jesus, our Leader and Reward,
    Our Saviour and our God.

    4. He, for the joy before Him set,
    (So boundless was His love,) 
    Endur’d the cross, despis’d the shame. 
    And now He sits above.

    5. If He unnumber’d griefs and wrongs
    With meekness did sustain,
    O how can we, whose sins He bore, 
    Of lighter ills complain!
 
 

## 111.  'Nothing but Thy blood, O Jesus'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p_xQylXfSbav6pa_NQJAMTDPT49qao81/edit?mode=html)



1\. Nothing but Thy blood, O Jesus,\
Could relieve the sinner's sm art;\
Nothing else from guilt release us,\
Nothing else could melt the heart.\
\
2. Sense of sin doth only harden\
All the while it works alone;\
But the grace that seals our pardon,\
Soon dissolves a heart of stone.\

1.12 -11 3
 
 

## 112.  'Jesus! before Thy face we fall.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjXgJoyfkgIt9YKUmAtc5rbnZe0Ggq0X/edit?mode=html)



    Jesus! before Thy face we fall,
    Our Lord, our life, our hope, our all;
    For we have no where else to flee;
    No Sanctuary, Lord, but Thee.

    2. In Thee we ev’ry glory view,
    Of safety, strength, and beauty to o;
    ’Tis all our rest and peace to see 
    Our Sanctuary, Lord, in Thee.

    3. Whatever foes or fears betide,
    In Thy dear presence let us hide;
    And while we rest our souls on Thee,
    Do Thou our Sanctuary be.

    4. Through time, with all its changing scenes, 
    And all the grief that intervenes,
    Let this support each fainting heart,
    That Thou our Sanctuary art.
 
 

## 113.  'The Cross! the Cross! O that''s our gain.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oXldptNWRk3aftgDb7hA6jFjKoEr5Kkw/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Cross! the Cross! O that’s our gain, 
    Because on that the Lamb was slain;
    ’Twas there the Lord was crucified,
    ’Twas there for us the Saviour died.1 14

    2. What wondrous cause could move Thy heart, 
    To take on Thee our curse and smart,
    Well knowing we should ever be 
    So cold, so negligent of Thee!

    3. The cause was love,—we sink with shame 
    Before our blessed Jesu’s nam e;
    That He should bleed and suffer thus,
    Because He lov’d and pitied us.
 
 

## 114.  'Saviour divine, Whose name we know'

    1. S aviour divine, Whose name we know,
    In Whom alone we trust,
    Thou art the Lord our Righteousness,
    Thou art Thy people’s boast.

    2. The soul, by sin howe’er defil’d,
    By guilt howe’er opprest,
    In Thee believing, stands approv’d,
    And finds abiding rest.

    3. To Thee, our great redeeming Lord,
    What lasting thanks we owe,
    For raising sinners to such joys,
    From depths of endless w oe!
 
 

## 115.  'Awake, each saint, in joyful lays'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBlsXsQhluLJZdAtmxDY%2DgSXN4iHbHzH/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, each saint, in joyful lays,
    To sing thy great Redeemer's praise 
    He justly claims a song from thee:
    His loving-kindness, O how free!

    2. He saw thee ruin’d in the fall,
    Yet lov’d thee, notwithstanding all;
    He sav’d thee from thy low estate:
    His loving-kindness, O how great!

    3. Though num’rous hosts of mighty foes, 
    Though earth and hell its way oppose; 
    He safely leads His church along:
    His loving-kindness, O how strong!

    4. When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
    Has gather’d thick, and thunder”d loud; 
    He with His Church has always stood: 
    His loving-kindness, O how good!

    5. Soon shall we mount and soar away,
    To the bright realms of endless day; 
    And sing with rapture and surprise,
    His loving-kindness in the skies.116

    1. G reat the joy when Christians m eet; 
    Christian fellowship how sweet! 
    When, their theme of praise the same, 
    They exalt Jehovah’s name!

    2. Sing ye then eternal love,
    Such as did the Father move:
    He beheld the world undone;
    Lov’d the world, and gave His Son.

    3. Sing the Son’s unbounded love;
    How He left the realms above;
    To rejoin the Father’s side
    With a blood-bought spotless Bride.

    4. In the love too, make your boast,
    That vouchsaf’d the Holy Ghost,
    He has chas’d the mists away,
    Turn’d our night to glorious day.

    5. Sweet the thought, exceeding sw eet! 
    We shall soon in glory meet,
    There to raise a sweeter strain,
    Of redeeming love again.

    1. May we, O God! Thy mind express, 
    Stand forth Thy chosen witnesses;
    Thy pow’r unto salvation shew,
    In love and holiness below.

    2. The fulness of Thy grace-receive,
    And simply to Thy glory live;
    Strongly reflect the light divine,
    And in a world of darkness shine.

    3. In us let all mankind behold
    How Christians liv’d in days of old; 
    Mighty their envious foes to move,
    A prbverb of reproach—and love.

    4. O make us of one soul and heart,
    The all-conforming mind impart,
    And grant us peace and unity 1
    As taught, renew’d, and rul’d by Thee.

    1. O God, our languid hearts inspire, 
    (For here we know Thou a rt);
    And freely of Thy heav’nly fire,
    To every soul impart.119

    2. For Jesus’ sake, we pray Thee, here
    Thy presence now display;
    As Thou hast giv’n a place for pray’r, 
    So give us faith to pray.

    3. Amongst us, Lord, let holy peace,
    And love, and concord dwell;
    And give each troubl’d conscience ease, 
    Each wounded spirit heal.

    4. May we in faith' receive Thy word,

    And in the bosom of our Lord 
    Cast off our ev’ry care.

    Peace, the fruit of pardon’d sin, 
    Peace, that speaks its heaVnly Giver— 
    Peace to worldly minds unknown, 
    Peace divine, that flows for ever 
    From its source, the Lord alone!

    2. Prince of Peace, be ever near us,
    Till Thou take us to Thy home!
    Till Thy bright appearing cheer us,
    Till Thy peaceful kingdom come!
    Deign,—with sweetest consolation,
    Deign to give our souls to prove 
    All the pow’r of Thy salvation,
    Full submission, faith, and love!

    1. Loo k, ye saints, look there and wonder!
    See the place where Jesus lay:
    He has burst the bands asunder;
    He has borne our sins away.
    Joyful tidings!
    Yes, the Lord is ris’n, we say.

    2. Jesus triumph’d! Sing ye praises;
    By His death He overcame:

    Sing ye praises!
    Praises to the Victor’s name.

    See “the Man of Sorrows” now,121
    From the fight returned victorious,
    Ev’ry knee to Him doth bow.
    Crown Him! Crown Him!
    Crowns become the Victor’s brow.

    2. Crown the Saviour! Angels, own H im!
    Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
    In the seat of pow’r enthrone Him, 
    While the vault of heaven rings, 
    Crown H im! Crown H im!
    Crown the Saviour, “King of kings!

    3. Sinners in derision crown’d Him
    Mocking thus the Saviour’s claim: 
    Saints and angels, crowd around Him, 
    Own His title, praise His name; 
    Crown H im! Crown H im!
    Spread abroad the Victor’s fame,

    4. H ark! those bursts of acclamation:
    H ark! those loud triumphant chords! 
    Jesus takes the highest station,
    O what joy the sight affords!
    Crown Him! Crown Him!
    “King of kings, and Lord of lords!”

    1. Soon shall Israel, long dispersed,
    Mourning, seek the Lord their God; 
    Look on Him Whom once they pierced, 
    Own and kiss the chast’ning rod.

    2. Then all Isr’el shall be saved,
    War and tum ult then shall cease; 
    While the Blessed Son of David 
    Rules a conquer’d world in peace.

    3. Zion’s King shall reign victorious,
    All the earth shall own His sway;
    He will make His kingdom glorious, 
    And shall reign through endless day.
 
 

## 123.  'Grace ''tis a charming sound.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v8mvLlTQFrsDHKkw0HsX5lzOasVX0I5t/edit?mode=html)



    1. Grace!’Tis a charming sound,
    Harmonious to the ear;
    Heav’n with the echo shall resound, 
    And all the earth shall hear.

    2. Grace taught our wand’ring feet
    To tread the heav'nly road;
    And new supplies, each hour we meet, 
    While walking thus with God.124

    3.’Twas Grace that wrote each name
    In Life’s eternal book;
    ’Twas Grace that gave us to the Lamb 
    Whp all our sorrows took.

    4. Grace sav’d us from the foe,
    Grace taught us how to p ray;
    And God will ne’er His grace forego,
    Till we have won the day.

    5. May Grace, free Grace, inspire
    Our souls with strength divine;
    May all our thoughts to God aspire,
    And Grace in service shine.

    1. Your praises hither bring,
    Your Lord, ye saints, adore;
    Let us give thanks and sing,
    And triumph evermore.
    Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
    Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice.

    2. With Christ our theme begins
    The Lord of truth and love,
    When He had purg’d our sins 
    He took His seat above.
    Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
    Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice.

    3. His kingdom cannot fail,
    He’ll rule o’er earth and heav’n,
    The keys of death and hell 
    To Him alone are giv’n.
    Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
    Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice.

    4. Rejoice in glorious hope:
    Jesus, the Lord, shall come,
    And take His brethren up 
    To their eternal home.
    Lift up your hearts, lift up your voice, 
    Rejoice, again we say, rejoice.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v509_N5zeKmkg1h8uOo%2Dt3PNUx7kIe7I/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord, accept our feeble song!
    Pow’r and praise to Thee belong;
    We would all Thy grace record,
    Holy, holy, holy Lord!

    2. Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop, 
    Thence is all Thy people’s hope;
    Thou wast poor, that we might be 
    Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.

    3. When we think of love like this,
    Joy and shame our hearts possess;
    Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus, 
    Shame, for such returns from us.

    4. Yet we hope the day to see,
    When we shall from sin be free;
    When to Thee in glory brought,
    We shall serve Thee as we ought.

    1. To Him that sav’d us from the world,
    And wash’d us in His blood,
    Call’d us to share His glorious Throne, 
    As Kings and Priests to God.

    2. To Him shall ev’ry tongue be praise,
    And ev’ry heart be love!
    All grateful honours paid on earth,
    And nobler songs above!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v3YFKp7jy2c2fzGUf_PPdMUfzovrZjRo/edit?mode=html)



    1. Rock of Ages! cleft for me,
    Grace hath hid me safe in Thee! 
    Where the water and the blood,
    From Thy wounded side which flow’d,
    Are of sin the double cure;
    Cleansing from its guilt and pow’r.

    2. Not the labour of my hands
    Could fulfil the Law’s demands; 
    Could my zeal no respite know, 
    Could my tears for ever flow, 
    Nothing could for sin atone—
    But Thy blood, and Thine alone!

    3. Nothing in my hand I brought,
    But to Thee for mercy sought: 
    Naked, came to Thee for dress: 
    Helpless, look’d to Thee for grace: 
    Yet, tho’ lost, undone 1 came 
    Wash’d'and justified! am!

    4. While 1 draw this fleeting breath,
    If my eyelids close in death,
    When I soar to worlds unknown, 
    Still of Thee I’ll sing alone:— 
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    All my boast and jo y’s in Thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v_LoLda6pEGJCKLFs%2Dtf6b5yhZ5ovxH%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1. Bride of the Lamb! awake, awake 1 
    Why sleep for sorrow now?128
    The hope of glory, Christ, is thine,
    A child of glory thou.

    2. Thy spirit through the lonely night,
    From earthly joy apart,
    Hath sigh’d for one that’s far away,
    The Bridegroom of thy heart.

    3. But see, the night is waning fast,
    The breaking mom is near,
    And Jesus comes with voice of love, 
    Thy drooping heart to cheer.

    4. He comes—for O His yearning heart
    No more can bear delay,
    To scenes of full unmingled joy 
    To call His Bride away.

    5. This earth, the scene of all His woe,
    A homeless wild to thee,
    Full soon upon His heav’nly throne 
    Its rightful King shall see.

    6. Thou too shalt reign—He will not wear
    His crown of joy alone,
    And Earth His royal Bride shall see 
    Beside Him on the throne.

    7. Then weep no more,’tis all thine own, 
    His crown, His joy divine,
    And sweeter far than all beside,
    He, He Himself is thine.
 
 

## 129.  A pilgrim through this lonely world.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v_RyFuucSahhs7osSPhEenHvqQCyp42C/edit?mode=html)



    1. A pilgrim through this lonely world
    The blessed Saviour pass’d,
    A mourner all His life was He,
    A dying Lamb at last.

    2. That tender heart that felt for all,
    For all its life-blood gave;
    It found on earth no resting-place,
    Save only in the grave.

    3. Such was our Lord—and shall we fear
    The cross with all its scorn?
    Or love a faithless evil world 
    That wreath’d His brow with thorn?

    4. No—facing all its frowns or smiles,
    Like Him, obedient still,
    We homeward press through storm or calm, 
    To Zion’s blessed hill.130

    5. In tents we dwell amid the waste,
    Nor turn aside to roam 
    In folly’s paths, nor seek our rest 
    Where Jesus had no home.

    6. Dead to the world with Him Who died
    To win our hearts—our love,
    We, risen with our risen Head,
    In spirit dwell above.

    7. By faith His boundless glories there
    Our wond’ring eyes behold,
    Those glories which eternal years 
    Shall never all unfold.

    8. This fills our hearts with deep desire
    To lose ourselves in love,
    Bears all our hopes from earth away, 
    And fixes them above.

    I’Tis come—the glad millennial m o m! 
    The Son of David reigns—
    Sing, sing, O earth! for thou art free, 
    And Satan is in chains—

    2. Rejoice, for thou shalt feel no more
    The ruthless tyrant’s rod,
    Nor lose again the gracious smile 
    Of thine incarnate God.

    3. But chiefly thou, O Solyma!
    Thou queen of cities, sing,
    With shouts of triumph welcome now 
    The morning-star, thy King.

    4. He, gracious Saviour, faithful still
    To thee, His faithless dove,
    Forgives thee all, and bids thee dwell 
    Within His breast of love.

    5. Nor thee alone, for see, on high
    His Saints triumphant now,
    With all the hosts of Seraphim,
    In ceaseless worship bow.

    6. On Him the happy myriads there
    Unwearied love to gaze,
    There He amid His brethren dwells, 
    The Leader of their praise.

    7. Oh blessed Lord! we little dream’d
    Of such a morn as th is!
    Such rivers of unmingled joy,
    Such full unbounded bliss.131

    8. And O how sweet the happy thought I
    That all we taste or see,
    We owe it to the dying Lamb,
    We owe it all to Thee.

    9. Yes, dearest Saviour, one with Thee,
    Sweet source of joy divine!
    With Thee we live, with Thee we reign, 
    And we are wholly Thine.
 
 

## 131.  We are not come to the burning brow.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLzFE2tNJ56sd5mbWtmXqSeJ2Mv_NYWT/edit?mode=html)



    1. W e are not come to the burning brow, 
    Whence the fiery streams of vengeance flow, 
    To the voice of words, and the trumpet-sound, 
    Where the prostrate hosts lay quaking round;

    2. But we are come to the angels’ abode,
    That numberless wait round the throne of God, 
    Tothechurch of the first-born enroll’d on high, 
    And the spirits of saints who no more may die;

    3. And we are come to the sprinkled shrine, 
    Where Justice and Mercy unitedly shine,
    And the still, small voice of the blood that shed 
    It’s blessing on the murderer’s head:

    4.’Tis “Peace” to us our God thus speaks, 
    Before His vengeance in thunder breaks;
    He shall shake the skies, the seas and the shore, 
    He shall shake them once, and shall shake no 
    ,jnore.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiGINsiWMyTaoPH4cj4h2hZeGyIZ_x%2DC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, ye saints, arise! too long
    In heaviness we sing,
    ’Tis time to raise a gladlier song,
    And strike a louder string;

    2. In faith we wait for that dear place
    The lov’d Apostle view’d,
    When full before his ravish’d gaze,
    The Holy City stood.

    3. L o! where the pearly gates unfold,
    A kingly, priestly train,
    With robes of white, and crowns of gold, 
    Ascend with Christ to re ign!

    4. No moon, in borrow’d glory bright,
    No Sun, remotely fair;
    Jehovah-Jesus is the light,
    Their joy—The Lord is there l

    5. God of the new Jerusalem,
    From Thee this glory flows,
    Be ours the grace that prosper’d them,
    And ours the same repose.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qREECGH1z3R3N4cU0FpYeLHoBHmYu7CT/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father of Glory, we would know 
    The richest gifts Thine hands bestow;
    » The hope of our high calling see,
    ! And scan our immortality.

    2. Th’ exceeding greatness of Thy pow’r 
    To us-ward who believe, secure,
    The depths of love Thy wisdom plann’d, 
    The works and wonders of Thy hand.

    3. This was the power in Jesus wrought, 
    "When from the dead the Son was brought, 
    Then set at God’s right hand on high, 
    Above all principality.

    4. Above dominion, might, and name,
    Of noblest rank, or widest fame,
    In this our earthly, fading home,
    Or worlds, or kingdoms yet to come.

    5. Thus to the Son were all things given,
    All for the Church, the Bride of heaven, 
    Jehovah-Jesus’ meet abode,
    The fulness of th’ unbounded God.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qcO2pg2pOUsmc3coTwCC3lyrj_bdh0uJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour, haste! our souls are waiting
    For the long expected day,
    When, new heav’ns and earth creating, 
    Thou shalt banish grief away,
    All the sorrow,
    Caus’d by sin and Satan’s sway.

    2. H aste! O hasten Thine appearing!
    Take Thy mourning people home: 
    ’Tis this hope our spirits cheering, ■ 
    While we in the desert roam,
    Makes Thy people
    Strangers here, till Thou dost come.

    3. Lord, how long shall the creation
    Groan and travail sore in pain; 
    Waiting for its sure salvation,
    When Thou shalt in glory reign,
    And like Eden,
    This sad earth shall bloom again?

    4. Gather, too, Thy chosen nation,
    Israel’s long afflicted race;
    Let them find Thy free salvation,
    Own and trust Thy wondrous grace; 
    And adoring,
    Look on Thy once marred face.

    5. Reign, O reign, Almighty Saviour! 
    Heav’n and earth in one unite; 
    Make it known, that in Thy favour, 
    There alone is life and light: 
    When we see Thee,
    We shall have unmix’d delight.

    1. O L ord! Who now art seated,
    Above the Heav’ns on high,
    (The gracious work completed,
    For which Thou cam’st to die);
    To Thee our hearts are lifted,
    While pilgrims wand’ring here,
    For Thou alone art gifted 
    Our ev’ry weight to bear.

    2. We know that Thou hast bought us,
    And wash’d us in Thy blood;
    We know Thy grace has brought us, 
    As kings and priests to God.
    We know that soon the morning, 
    Long look’d-for hast’neth near, 
    When we, at Thy returning,
    In glory shall appear.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRSmxI_jiES2gQJgOKxsJrP6lEJE5nDH/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Lord, Thy love’s unbounded!
    So full, so vast, so free!
    Our thoughts are all confounded 
    Whene’er we think of Thee:
    For us Thou cams’t from Heav’n,
    For us to bleed and die;
    That purchas’d and forgiven,
    We might ascend on High.

    2. O let this, love constrain us
    To give our hearts to Thee:
    Let nothing henceforth pain us,
    But that which paineth Thee.
    Our joy, our one endeavour—
    Thro’ sufFring, conflict, shame,—
    To serve Thee, gracious Saviour,
    And magnify Thy name.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUkmi3aXaHgFY4A_xbavOGxgxVknt7xV/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hark J how the blood-bought hosts above, 
    Conspire to chaunt the Saviour’s love,
    In sweet harmonious strains!
    And while they strike their golden lyres, 
    This glorious theme each bosom fires,
    That Grace triumphant reigns!2 W e’ll join the song! for we can tell 
    How sov’reign grace dissolv’d the spell,
    That kept us bound in chains;
    And from that dear and happy day,
    How oft, by grace constrain’d to say 
    That Grace triumphant reigns!

    3. For tho’ w e’ve stray’d like saints of old, 
    Grace has restor’d us to the fold
    As captives in its chains;
    Thus, sav’d by grace, w e’d gladly sing,
    Till all the Heav’ns and earth should ring 
    With “Grace triumphant reigns! ”

    4. Grace still,—till all redeem’d by blood 
    Are taught to know themselves and God,—
    Its empire shall maintain;
    To spoil the mighty of the prey,
    And set the captive exile free,
    Shall Grace triumphant reign.

    5. Then,—call’d to meet the church’s Head, 
    The Saviour’s grace shall banish dread,
    His love our souls sustain;
    And, as we rise to endless day,
    W e’ll raise the voice, and boldly say,
    Grace doth triumphant reign!

    1. Jesus, Thou glorious Priest and King,
    Accept the tribute which we bring;
    Accept each feeble song of praise,
    Which here on earth Thy saints may raise.

    2. May every minute as it flies,
    Increase our love, improve our jo ys;
    Till we are brought to sing Thy name 
    At the great supper of the Lamb.

    3. O that the months would roll away,
    And quickly bring the marriage-day;
    When Thou the Lamb shalt take Thy throne, 
    And fully there the Church shalt own.

    4. The gladness of that happy day,
    In this sad world’s our strength and stay— 
    Then let not faith forsake its hold,
    Lest comfort sink, and love grow cold.

    In Satan’s bondage held;
    The Tyrant’s thraldom to destroy, 
    And make th’ Usurper yield.

    3. He comes! the mighty foe to bind,
    The groaning earth to free;
    While (chief of all free grace’s gifts) 
    Himself its Lord shall be.

    4. Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
    Thy welcome shall proclaim;
    And all creation shall rejoice 
    In Thy beloved name.
 
 

## 140.  How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qwVgKxf6FKvCVy_4wqj3ph6RIxJ5h1Jd/edit?mode=html)



    1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
    In a believer’s ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
    And drives away his fear.

    2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
    And calms the troubled breast;
    Tis manna to the hungry soul,
    And to the weary rest.

    3. Dear nam e! the rock on which I build;
    My shield and hiding-place;
    My never-failing treas’ry, fill’d 
    With boundless stores of grace.

    4. Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
    My Prophet, Priest, and King;
    My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, 
    Accept the praise I bring.

    5. Weak is the effort of my heart,
    And cold my warmest thou ght;
    But when I see Thee as Thou art,
    I’ll praise Thee as I ought.

    6. Till then I would Thy love proclaim
    W ith ev’ry fleeting breath;
    And triumph in that blessed name 
    Which quells the power of Death.

    1. Jesus, the Christ! eternal W ord! 
    Of all creation Sovereign Lord!
    On Thee alone, by faith we rest;
    And lean our weakness on Thy breast.

    2. Thy blood hath wash’d us from our sin; 
    Thy Spirit sanctifies w ithin!
    And Thou for us, in all our need,
    At God’s right hand dost ever plead.

    3. O keep us in the narrow way,
    That ne’er from Thee our footsteps stray: 
    Sustain our weakness; calm our fear;
    And to Thy presence keep us near.

    4. And be it thus till th at blest day,
    When God shall wipe all tears away.
    " Quickly”—’tis promis’d in the word; 
    E’en so. Amen. Come quickly, Lord!

    1. H ope of our hearts! O Lord, appear,
    Thou glorious Star of day!
    Shine forth, and chase the dreary night, 
    With all our tears, away.

    2. Strangers on earth, we wait for Thee:
    O leave the Father’s throne;
    Come, with a shout of vict’ry, Lord, 
    And claim us as Thine own.

    3. O bid the bright archangel, then,
    The trump of God prepare,
    To call Thy saints—the quick—the dead— 
    To meet Thee in the air.

    4. No resting place we seek on earth,
    No loveliness we see;
    Our eye is on the royal crown 
    Prepar’d for us and Thee.

    5. But O the thought of sharing, Lord,
    Thy glorious throne above,
    What is it to the brighter hope 
    Of dwelling in Thy love?

    6. What to the joy—the deeper joy,
    Unmingled, pure, and free,
    Of union with our living Head,—
    Of fellowship with Thee?

    7. This joy e’en nowon earth is ouF s;
    But only, Lord, above,14 3
    Thy saints, without a pang, shall know 
    The fulness of Thy love.

    8. There, near Thy heart, upon the throne, 
    Thy ransom’d Bride shall see 
    What grace was in the bleeding Lamb, 
    Who died to make her free.

    2. We love the brethren, Lord,’tis true,
    But O in them we see 
    Sweet traces of Thy blessed self,
    For they are one with Thee.145

    3. And one with us—bu t O’twas thine
    Thine only, Lord, to part 
    With life, and all that love could give, 
    To win the wand’ring heart.

    4. Thus, heirs of endless bliss with Thee,
    We love Thee—we adore—
    Ah! give us all still greater grace 
    To love Thee more and more!
 
 

## 145.  Since Christ and we are one
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sBzFj4C14Nf0CIim2bKv0G9kLOWv8ZG_/edit?mode=html)



    1. Since Christ and we are one,
    Why should we doubt or fear?— 
    He sits upon the Father’s throne, 
    And in Him we are there.

    2. The Spirit doth unite
    Our souls to Him our Head, 
    And forms us to His image bright 
    While we His footsteps tread.

    3. And grace it is—free grace—
    Which keeps us on the road,
    Till we behold the Saviour’s face, 
    And city of our God.
 
 

## 146.  All things that God or man could wish
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sauGOTdWGaV7n_mux4uoBqp5rx1NkrZ8/edit?mode=html)



    1. All things that God or man could wish,
    In Jesus richly meet;
    Not to our eyes is light so dear,
    Or friendship half so sweet.

    2. O may His Name still cheer our hearts,
    And shed its fragrance there!
    The sweetest balm of ev’ry wound,
    The cure of ev’ry care.
 
 

## 147.  'Brightness of the Father''s glory'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTZRV9L6KejvSkVvqIF%2Df_wP%2DjBJJZ8m/edit?mode=html)



    1. Brightness of the Father’s glory,
    Shall Thy praise unutter’d lie?
    Who would hush the boundless story, 
    Of the Lamb Who came to die;

    2. Came from off the throne eternal,
    Down to Calv’ry’s depth of woe, 
    Came to crush the pow’rs infernal?— 
    Streams of praises ceaseless flow!

    3. Sing the Lamb’s triumphant rising;
    Sing Him on the Father’s throne;148—14 9
    Sing—till heav’n and earth surprising, 
    Reigns the Nazarene alone.
 
 

## 148.  'See! See, the blessed Saviour comes.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sN9k4SlUNce%2DUMcVjlrJ9EU0MqGQY095/edit?mode=html)



    1. See! See, the blessed Saviour comes,
    The God of love and grace;
    With Him we spend eternity 
    In pleasure and in praise.

    2. For ever still our wond’ring eyes
    Shall o’er His beauties rove;
    To endless ages we adore 
    The wonders of His love!
 
 

## 149.  'I''m glad I know that Christ shall reign.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJDGk2p30STzYsok42rmJow4lVT_QG4J/edit?mode=html)



    1. I’m glad I know that Christ shall reign 
    In glory, glory, glory,
    And come to earth on clouds again, 
    With glory, glory, glory:
    ’Tis glory’s foretaste makes me sing 
    Of glory, glory, glory,
    And to the Saviour praises bring;
    Sing glory, glory, glory!

    2.' I hope to see Him on His throne,
    Sing glory, glory, glory!
    When He shall come to meet His own,
    In glory, glory, glory!
    I’ll sing, while, mounting through the air 
    Of glory, glory, glory!
    And meet my Father’s children there,
    In glory, glory, glory!

    3. Come on, my friends, let’s mend our pace 
    To glory, glory, glory!
    For we shall see Him face to face,
    In glory, glory, glory!
    The Bride shall reign—the Bridegroom too, 
    In glory, glory, glory I 
    Let’s keep the blessed prize in view:
    'Tis glory, glory, glory!
 
 

## 150.  'The God Who dwells above, we call.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sF03nQvxuYaQJ5EP1XMhHcs_70Hr8Ucp/edit?mode=html)



    1. The God Who dwells above, we call
    Our Father and our Friend:
    And, blessed th ou gh t! His children all 
    Shall see Him in the end.

    2. Though now dispers’d, the day will come
    When He Who made us His,151
    Will take us hence, and bear us home 
    To see Him as He is,

    3. Though now unknown, we then shall be
    The sons of God confess’d;
    Those Who disown us then shall see 
    That we alone are bless’d.

    4. Then let us, brethren, while on earth,
    With foes and strangers mix’d,
    Be mindful of our heav’nly birth,
    Our thoughts on glory fix’d.

    5. That we should glorify Him here
    Our Father’s purpose is;
    And when the Saviour shall appear,
    He will declare us His.
 
 

## 151.  Not to ourselves we owe.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLV9BRgYle%2DwQsoznS%2D_IdlpwL0h5Fcl/edit?mode=html)



    1. N ot to ourselves we owe 
    That we, O God, are Thine;
    Jesus, the Sun, our night broke through, 
    And gave us light divine.

    2. The Father’s grace and love,
    This blessed mercy gave,
    And Jesus left the throne above,
    The wand’ring sheep to save.

    3. No more the heirs of wrath,—
    The smile of peace we see;
    And, Father, in confiding faith,
    We cast our souls on Thee.

    4. We drink the living stream
    To all Thy children giv’n,
    The love which Thou hast made to beam 
    From Christ, the Heir of Heaven.

    5. With the adopted band,
    Soon shall we see Thee there;
    With them and Him in glory stand,
    And all His honours share.
 
 

## 152.  'It hath not fully yet appear''d'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDXXkopA%2D6MklfBCWSm2VWuESbk2DalO/edit?mode=html)



    1. It hath not fully yet appear’d
    What blessedness to saints is giv’n; 
    No eye hath seen, no ear hath heard, 
    No heart conceiv’d the joy of heav’n.153

    2. The mind of God, and it alone,
    The joy prepar’d hath understood;
    "When saints shall know as they are known, 
    And shall behold the face of God—

    3. The face of Him, Who here below
    Appear’d, and died to save His own;
    The same Who dwells in glory now,
    And sits upon the Father’s throne.

    4. The sight of Him His saints shall fill
    With transport never known before;
    They’ll feel no want, and fear no ill,
    Nor sin nor sorrow any more.

    5. Then blest our lo t! for we are His,
    And we shall dwell with Him above;
    Yea, we shall see Him as He is,
    The Lord of grace, of truth, and love.
 
 

## 153.  When will the trumpet loud proclaim.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pXxogkQ%2DMdooFf66O9Qe0SoEskA_10As/edit?mode=html)



    1. When will the trumpet loud proclaim 
    The judgment of the martyr’d Lamb? 
    When will the captive saints be free, 
    And keep th’ eternal jubilee?

    2. O Father, let that day appear,
    The promis’d Great Sabbatic Year;
    When freed from sin, and toil, and pain, 
    Thy ransom’d shall in glory reign.

    3. Till then we cannot let Thee rest,
    But still repeat our strong request;
    And this our constant cry shall be,
    Lord, sound the trump of jubilee.
 
 

## 154.  'And art Thou, gracious Master, gone'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9iwPXoVDHJleeLFhQr4nMZosPDwEnnT/edit?mode=html)



    1. And art Thou, gracious Master, gone,
    A mansion to prepare for me?
    Shall I behold Thee on Thy throne,
    And there for ever sit with Thee? 
    Then let the world approve or blame,
    I’ll triumph in Thy glorious name.

    2. Should I, to gain the world’s applause,
    Or to escape its harmless frown, 
    Refuse to countenance Thy cause,
    And make Thy people’s lot mine own, 
    W hat shame would fill me in that day 
    When Thou Thy glory shalt display!

    3. N o; let the world cast out my name,
    And vile account me, if they will;155
    If to confess my Lord be shame,
    I purpose to be viler still;
    For Thee, my God, I’d all resign,
    Content th at I can call Thee mine.

    4. For ah! what joy will fill my heart,
    When Thou my worthless name shalt own, 
    When I shall see Thee as Thou art,
    And know as I myself am known:
    When I, from sin and sorrow free,
    Shall like my Lord for ever be.
 
 

## 155.  'Ye watchful saints arise!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyVPSjZvCYTfybgeuzBtVXl9Sz5RZGmK/edit?mode=html)



    1. Y e watchful saints, arise!
    Quick, from the dead awake!
    Unto salvation wise,
    Oil in your vessels take;
    Awake 1 and hear the midnight cry,
    “Behold the heav’nly Bridegroom nigh.”

    2. He comes, He comes to call
    The nations to His bar,
    And raise to glory all 
    Who call’d to glory a re;
    Make ready for your full reward,
    And go with joy to meet your Lord.

    3. To meet Him in the sky,
    Your everlasting Friend; —
    Your Head to glorify,
    With all His saints,—ascend; 
    There see the Saviour face to face* 
    And sing for ever of His grace.

    4. Brethren, this is our hope
    (Let it to all be known),
    That we shall be caught up 
    To share the Saviour’s throne, 
    Call’d to partake the marriage feast, 
    Though of all saints the very least.

    5. Then let us wait to hear
    The trumpet’s welcome sound; 
    That when the Lord appear, 
    Watching may we be found! 
    Cloth’d in the righteousness divine, 
    In which His Bride shall ever shine.
 
 

## 156.  We sing the praise of Him Who died.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPvG3nx%2Dii_PG6E5210gcyNgym9jmymV/edit?mode=html)



    1. W e sing the praise of Him Who died, 
    Of Him Who died upon the cross, 
    The sinner’s H o p e-let men deride;
    For this we count the world but loss.


    2. Inscrib’d upon the cross we see,
    In shining letters, " God i s Love!* 
    The Lamb Who died upon the tre e;
    Has brought us mercy from above.

    3. The Cross! it takes our guilt away,
    It holds the fainting spirit up;
    It cheers with hope the gloomy day,
    And sweetens ev’ry bitter cup.

    4. It makes the coward spirit brave,
    And nerves the feeble arm for fight;
    It takes its terror from the grave,
    And gilds the bed of death with light.

    5. The balm of life, the cure of woe,
    The measure and the pledge of love, 
    The sinners’ refuge here below,
    The angels’ theme in heav’n above.
 
 

## 157.  O Thou Who didst thy glory leave.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oxHhQ8HJzAR0ZLf6AtAaxZtVljbE5Vy6/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Thou Who didst Thy glory leave, 
    Apostate sinners to retrieve 
    From nature’s deadly fall;
    As Thou hast bought us with a price, 
    Our sins against us ne’er can rise, 
    For Thou hast borne them all.

    2. We sing One smitten in our stead, 
    Him Who without the city bled
    To expiate our stain;
    Who, God of God, vouchsaf’d to dwell 
    In flesh, to make of full avail 
    The sufFrings of the man.

    3. See Him for our transgressions giv’n, 
    See the incarnate God of heav’n,
    For us, His foes, expire;
    Rejoice! rejoice! the tidings hear!
    He bore, that we might never bear,
    His Father’s righteous ire.

    4. Ye saints, “the Man of sorrows” bless, 
    The Lord, for your unrighteousness
    Deputed to atone;
    Praise, till with all the ransom’d throng 
    Ye sing the never-ending song,
    And sit upon His throne!
 
 

## 158.  'Yes ''tis a rough and thorny road.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pEV4v0NqbSUMKOwDfscYB3e_BG5j80V2/edit?mode=html)



    1. Yes!’tis a rough and thorny road 
    That leads us to the saints’ abode;
    But when our Father’s house we gain, 
    'Twill make amends for all our pain.

    2. And though we feel our present grief,
    In hope we find a sweet relief;
    For hope anticipates the day,
    When all our grief shall pass away.

    3. And what is all we suffer now,
    Or all we can endure below,
    To that bright day when Christ shall come 
    And take His weary pilgrims home?

    4. Then let us tread, without complaint,
    The thorny road, and never faint;
    Though now by weariness opprest,
    The end is everlasting rest.
 
 

## 159.  O Head so full of bruises.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozQyWmVDGvi0Uft0gFCgPNdZXZTm_Fc%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1. O H ead! so full of bruises,
    So full of pain and scorn,
    ’Midst other sore abuses
    Mock’d with a crown of tho rn;
    O Head! e’en now surrounded 
    With brightest majesty,
    In death once bow’d and wounded, 
    Accursed on the tree.

    2. Thou Countenance transcendent!
    Thou life-creating Sun 
    To worlds on Thee dependent,
    Yet bruis’d and spit upon.
    O Lord! what Thee tormented 
    Was our sin’s heavy load,
    We had the debt augmented,
    Which Thou didst pay in blood.

    3. When sealing our election 
    Thy heart did break in woe,
    With shame and love’s affection, 
    That men should treat Thee so; 
    We know Thy love’s strong fervour 
    By all Thy pain and grief;
    Then hear us, Great Preserver,
    And worship now receive.
 
 

## 160.  We give Thee thanks unfeigned.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3S1BE3P5ipb%2Dwzsfe7age9QjI4zXZWk/edit?mode=html)



    1. We give Thee thanks unfeigned,
    O Jesus! Friend in need,
    For what Thy soul sustained,
    When Thou for us didst bleed; 
    Grant us to lean unshaken 
    Upon Thy faithfulness;
    Until to glory taken,
    We see Thee face to face.

    2. And O what consolation
    Doth in our hearts take place, 
    While we Thy toil and passion 
    Do joyfully retrace!
    Ah! should we, while thus musing 
    On our Redeemer’s cross,161
    E’en life itself be losing,
    Great gain would be that loss.
 
 

## 161.  'O Saviour, we are Thine'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzkVys7nKaWi%2Dhqh27qp6dqGTLdIB6XF/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Saviour, we are Thine
    In everlasting bands;
    Our names, our hearts, we would resign 
    Into Thy gracious hands.

    2. To Thee we now would cleave
    With firm and faithful zeal,
    Though often press’d Thy paths to leave, 
    Oh let not sin prevail!

    3. Our lives we’d gladly lose
    As not our own but Thine;
    For Thee the tempter’s wiles refuse,
    And all the world resign.

    4. Let nothing from us hide
    The glory of Thy day,
    But keep us ever near Thy side 
    Through all life’s gloomy way.

    5. Since Thou and we are one,
    We know we need not fear;
    If Thou in heav’n hast fix’d Thy throne 
    We too are fixed there.
 
 

## 162.  Let us rejoice in Christ the Lord.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1voKkoTcoKQ9mkCkVDejqsA1GdULCP2gY/edit?mode=html)



    1. Let us rejoice in Christ the Lord,
    Who claims us for His own;
    The hope th a t’s built upon His word, 
    Can ne’er be overthrown.

    2. Though many foes beset us round,
    And feeble is our arm,
    Our life is hid with Christ in God 
    Beyond the reach of harm.

    3. Weak as we are, we shall not faint,
    Or, fainting, cannot fail;
    Jesus, the strength of ev’ry saint,
    Must in the end prevail

    4. Though now He’s unperceiv’d by sense,
    Faith sees Him always near,—
    A guide, a glory, a defence,
    To save from ev’ry fear.

    5. As surely as He overcame,
    And conquer’d death and sin,
    So surely those that trust His name 
    Will all His triumph win.
 
 

## 163.  'Great Saviour of the church, we own.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vgY9TXxTvmnxBjVOp%2DUlPWK3AbDEPB69/edit?mode=html)



    1. Great Saviour of the church, we own
    Thy precepts all divinely wise;
    O may Thy mighty pow’r be known,
    To keep them all before our eyes.

    2. Deep on our hearts Thy word engrave,
    And fill our breasts with heav’nly zeal 
    That while we trust Thy Love to save, 
    We may Thy sacred word fulfil.

    3. Adorn’d with ev’ry heav’nly grace,
    May we in service brightly shine;
    And the full glory of Thy face 
    Reflected beam from each of Thine.

    4. That lovely image, true and fair,
    Our heav’nly Father shall proclaim; 
    And men that see its brightness there, 
    Shall join to glorify His name.

    5. Of tru th the pillar and the ground,
    May we continue all our days;
    In love and discipline be found,
    As truly witnessing His praise.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vbP6tRgXZHEfOSO6a66G14tTuuqdL_C4/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Son of God, Who once for us
    Did to the grave descend,
    Now lives in heaVn, our great High Priest, 
    And never-dying friend.

    2. Through life or death let us to Him
    With constancy adhere;
    Faith shall supply new strength, and hope 
    Shall banish ev’ry fear.
 
 

## 165.  He bids us come; His voice we know.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vfAW8QQRbUlO%2DVujZCK9qQAMF1q0n1NP/edit?mode=html)



    1. H e bids us come; His voice we know, 
    And boldly on the waters go,
    To Him our God and Lord;
    We walk on life’s tempestuous sea,
    For He Who died to set us free 
    Hath call’d us with His word

    2. Secure, on boist’rous waves we tread, 
    Nor all the billows round us dread,
    While to the Lord we look;
    The Tempter drives his vortex round; 
    We pass it as on solid ground;
    The wave is firm as rock.166

    3. But if from Him we turn the eye, 
    We see the raging floods run high,
    We feel our fears w ithin;
    Our foes so strong, our flesh so frail, 
    Reason and unbelief prevail,
    And plunge us into sin.

    4. Lord! we our unbelief confess,
    Do Thou our little faith increase,
    That we may doubt no m ore;
    But fix on Thee a steady eye,
    And on Thine outstretch’d arm rely, 
    Till all the storm is o’er.
 
 

## 166.  'Father, we commend our spirits'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaBkW3bRs54UP8BBLK8CxEohVc8tyft1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Father, we commend our spirits
    To Thy love in Jesu’s name,
    Love, which His atoning merits 
    Give us confidence to claim.

    2. O how sweet, how real a pleasure
    Flows from love so true and free! 
    O how great, how rich a treasure, 
    Saviour, we possess in Thee!

    3. From the world and its confusions
    Here we turn and find our rest,
    From its care and its delusions,
    Turn to Thee, and there are blest.

    4. Though this scene is ever changing,
    Since Thy mercy changes not,
    O’er the waste our spirits ranging 
    Glory in their happy lot.

    5. By the Holy Ghost anointed,
    May we do our Father’s will,
    Walk the path by Him appointed,
    Jesu’s pleasure to fulfil.

    6. Till the welcome signal hearing,
    Welcome to the saints alone,
    We rejoice at His appearing,
    Who shall claim us for His own.
 
 

## 167.  From far we see the glorious day.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vbfvErC13DRBUCEVMGWX8fuGFYod6vS5/edit?mode=html)



    1. From far we see the glorious day,
    When He Who bore our sins away,
    Will all His majesty display.

    2. “A Man of Sorrows” once He was,
    No friend was found to plead His cause,
    For all preferr’d the world’s applause.

    3. He groan’d beneath sin’s awful load,
    For in the sinner’s place He stood,
    And died to bring us back to God.

    4. But now He sits with glory crown’d, 
    While angel hosts the throne surround, 
    And still His lofty praises sound.

    5. To few on earth His name is dear;
    And they who in His cause appear,
    The world’s reproach and scorn must bear.

    6. Yet soon there is a day to come,
    When He will seal the scorner’s doom, 
    And take His mourning people home.

    7. Jesus, Thy name is all our boast;
    And though by waves of trouble tost, 
    Thou wilt not let Thine own be lost.

    8. Come then, come quickly from above,
    Our souls impatient long to prove 
    The depths of Thine eternal love.
 
 

## 168.  Great Leader of the Church of God.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1veF1btvMwDdeaYFiGE95rnQyN35czgiX/edit?mode=html)



    1. Great Leader of the church of God,
    We sing Thy conqu’ring name,
    Legions of foes beset Thee round,
    But all were put to shame.

    2. Avict’ry, glorious and complete,
    Thou by Thy death didst gain;
    So in Thy cause would we contend,
    And all for Thee sustain.

    3. While onward to the conflict led,
    No sorrow would we fear,
    Prepar’d our ransom’d lives to shed,
    Nor count them to us dear.

    4. W e’d trace the footsteps Thou hast trod
    To glory and renown;
    Sustain Thy combat and Thy cross,
    As call’d to share Thy crown.

    1. Brethren, awake, awake from sloth’.
    And bind the girdle o n;
    A heav’nly course before you lies,
    And an eternal crown.

    2.’Tis Jesu’s animating voice
    That calls you from on high,

    The crown of victory.

    3. Lord! help us still to follow Thee,
    Patient, the race to run,
    Till crown’d with vict’ry round Thy Throne, 
    We sing what grace has done.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhMgvN_T9yIXa0Re7jLAJb0v2z1gV%2D0%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1. The promise is fulfill’d,
    Salvation’s work is done;
    Justice and Mercy reconcil’d,
    For God has rais’d His Son.

    2. He left death’s sad abode,
    From all corruption free;
    The holy, harmless, Son of God 
    Could no corruption see.

    3. In Him the saints are ris’n,
    From guilt and judgment clear,
    And now upon the throne of heav’n,
    In Him their Head appear.
 
 

## 171.  How blest the bright morning appears.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4ka2H%2DebhaomUaEoTUuRR8atmRL8IEt/edit?mode=html)



    1. How blest the bright morning appears,
    When Jesus reviv’d from the grave!
    To banish for ever our fears,
    To triumph, almighty to save.
    How strong were His tears and His cries 1 
    The worth of His blood how divine 1 
    How perfect His one sacrifice,
    Who rose, though He suffer’d for sin!

    2. The Man, Whose mock-crown was of thorn,
    Whom sinners agreed to deride,
    The M an, Who bore scourging and scorn, 
    The Man, Who on Calvary died,
    Now blessed for ever is made,
    And life has rewarded His pain;
    Now glory encircles His head,
    Heav’n sings of the Lamb that was slain.

    3. And lo! when He cometh again,
    His foes shall be clothed with shame;
    But gladness the saints shall obtain,
    And glory, and peace, with the Lamb. 
    Then let us look forward to this,
    And joyfully take up His cross:
    As saints we shall be where He is,
    And all that we lose is but dross.
 
 

## 172.  Who is the wondrous Kin g.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCWb43N4yx3Xguv0rSR%2DAD51BkIGBgwE/edit?mode=html)



    1. Who is the wondrous King,
    Who there in glory stands?
    What title doth He bring,
    That worship He demands?
    Jehovah’s name, in battle strong,
    Alone can be the Church’s song.

    2. The pow’rs of hell oppos’d,
    When He in conflict bled;
    And death’s strong bars were clos’d 
    Round His expiring head: —
    But death and hell possess’d no pow’r, 
    To hold Him past th’ appointed hour.

    3.’Twas for the church He bled,
    ’Twas for the Church He rose,
    That she in Him, her Head,
    Might overcome all foes: —
    Jehovah Jesus is His name,
    And all His deeds His worth proclaim.

    4. Himself the Son of God,
    The Lord, from conquest come;
    He shed His precious blood,
    That we might share His home.
    Gladly we own His title, then,
    And at His feet in worship bend.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sq45lqwOAm4JwFLOFZx4jD_jbhhE4xkN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Foh Sion’s sake I will not rest;
    I will not hold my peace,
    Until Jerusalem be blest,
    And Judah dwell at ease.

    2. Until her righteousness return,
    As day-break after n igh t;
    The lamp of her salvation bum 
    With everlasting light.

    3. The Gentiles shall her glory view,
    And kings declare her fame,
    And hers shall be a title new,
    Which Israel’s God shall name.

    4. The Lord shall hold her with His hand,
    And wear her for His own,
    His diadem her beauteous land,
    Her royalty His crown.

    5. And ev’ry tribe, and ev’ry land,
    Shall hear the joyful word,174
    “The holy people are at hand,
    “Redeemed of the Lord.”
 
 

## 174.  The day comes on apace.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTpDiLWOsuS%2DKAYdjIpIvbVVuP%2DbJSdP/edit?mode=html)



    1. The day comes on apace,
    Soon shall the night be past:
    Who trust the Saviour’s grace 
    Shall see His face at last;
    The clouds that now obstruct their sight, 
    Shall quickly all be put to flight.

    2. Ye saints, lift up your heads,
    Salvation draweth nigh;
    See where the morning spreads 
    Its radiance through the sky;
    O let the sight your spirits cheer!
    The Lord Himself will soon appear.

    3. Though men your Hope deride
    (Nor will e’en God believe),
    Do you in Him confide,
    Whose word can ne’er deceive;
    When heav’n and earth shall pass away, 
    The saints shall see a glorious day.

    4. For you the Lord intends
    A bright abode on high,
    The place where sorrow ends,
    And nought is known but joy;
    With such a hope, ye saints, rejoice,
    Ye soon shall hear th’ archangel’s voice.
 
 

## 175.  The day of glory bearing.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ssFZGT8aBnPGQKlCHSRKKD71PpdwQv4u/edit?mode=html)



    1. The day of glory bearing
    Its brightness far and near,
    The day of Christ’s appearing 
    We now no longer fear;

    2. He once a spotless victim
    For us on Calv’ry bled; 
    Jehovah did afflict Him,
    And bruis’d Him in our stead.

    3. But now H e’s interceding
    For us who on Him r est;
    And grace from Him proceeding, 
    Tells us in Him we’re blest.

    4. Then let Him come in glory,
    Who comes His saints to raise, 
    To perfect all the story 
    Of wonder, love, and praise.

## 176.  'Here we rest,in wonder viewing'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1st14JWAM8eib6v9WsMiW3GCHuL9_UQIr/edit?mode=html)



    1. Here we rest,—in wonder viewing
    All our sins on Jesus laid!
    And a full redemption flowing 
    From the sacrifice He made.

    2. Truly blessed is the station!
    Thus upon the Lamb to rest,
    And to know in God’s salvation,
    How the saints are fully blest.

    3. Here we find the dawn of heaven.
    While upon the Lamb we gaze,
    See our trespasses forgiven,
    And our songs of triumph raise.

    4. O h! that strong in faith abiding,
    We may to the Saviour cleave, 
    Nought with Him our hearts dividing, 
    All for Him content to leave.

    5. May we still, God’s mind discerning,
    To the Lamb for wisdom go;
    There new wonders daily learning,
    All the Father’s glory know.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tITTIOvo%2DOILCj0V2PoXITBNJa8d20rs/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, lead us by Thy power
    Safe into the promis’d r est;
    Choose the paththe way whatever 
    Seems to Thee, O Lord! the best; 
    Be our guide in ev’ry peril,
    Watch and keep us night and day, 
    Else our foolish hearts will wander 
    From the straight and narrow way.

    2. Since in Thee we found redemption,
    And Salvation full and free,
    Nothing can our souls dishearten 
    But forgetfulness of Thee;
    Nought can stay our steady progress, 
    More than conq’rors we shall be,
    If our eye, whate’er the danger, 
    Looks to Thee, and none but Thee.

    3. In Thy presence we are happy;
    In Thy presence we’re secure;
    In Thy presence all afflictions 
    We can easily endure;1 7 8 -1 7 9
    In Thy presence we can conquer,
    We Can suffer, we can die;
    Wand’ring from Thee we are feeble;
    Let Thy love, then, keep us nigh.

    1. From Egypt lately freed,
    By the Redeemer’s grace,
    A rough and thorny path we tread.
    To see Him face to face

    2. The promis’d rest and peace
    Are still in constant view;
    How difFrent to the wilderness 
    We now are passing through!

    3. Here grief, and care, and pain,
    And fears distress us sore;
    But there celestial pleasures reign,
    And we shall weep no more.

    1. “We’ve no abiding city here
    This may distress the worldling’s mind, 
    But should not cost the saint a tear,
    Who hopes a better rest to find.

    2. “W e’ve no abiding city here
    Sad thought 1 were this to be our home 
    But let this truth our spirits cheer,
    We seek a city yet to come.

    3. “W e’ve no abiding city here
    Then let us live as pilgrims do;
    Let not the world our rest appear,
    But let us haste from all below.

    4. “W e’ve no abiding city here
    We seek a city out of sight,
    Jerusalem! faith sees it near,
    Brilliant with everlasting light.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGYHBcQzEWpJoWD0at8Hg_b8mLBaC9N3/edit?mode=html)



    1. Children of God! who, pacing slow,
    Your pilgrim path pursue,
    In strength and weakness, joy and woe, 
    To God’s high calling t ru e!

    2. Why move ye on with ling’ring tread,
    A doubtful, mourning band?
    Why faintly hangs the drooping head? 
    Why drops the feeble hand?181

    3. O! weak to know the Saviour’s pow’r,
    To trust the Father’s care;
    A moment’s toil, a passing show’r,
    Is all the grief ye share!

    4. The Lord of light, absent awhile
    Shall soon His glory bring,
    And you in all that glory smile,
    Whilst you His praises sing.

    5. Then rescu’d from the gloomy shroud
    Which doth this world invest,
    He’ll raise you on His glorious cloud, 
    And guide you to His rest
 
 

## 181.  Sweeter sounds than music knows
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1urXnvOUkFcM6Lf1dppC40qJd5Swf7gfh/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sweeter sounds than music knows,
    Charm us in the Saviour’s nam e;
    All the Church’s gladness flows
    From His birth, and cross, and shame

    2. Did the Lord a man become,
    That He might the law fulfil?
    Bleed and suffer in our room?
    And can any tongue be still?
    X82

    3. No, we will our praises bring,
    Though they worthless are and weak; 
    For, should we refuse to sing,
    Sure, the very stones would speak.

    4. O our Saviour! shield and sun,
    Shepherd, brother, husband, friend, 
    Ev’ry precious name in one,
    We would praise Thee without end.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uNOLty3LW27OmGKl6e9YbeiqkO_kuTkX/edit?mode=html)



    1. We long to behold Him array’d
    With glory and light from above, 
    The Lord in His beauty display’d,
    The beauty of holiest love.
    We hasten and sigh to be there, 
    Where Jesus shall fix His abode,
    To see Him descend in the air,
    With all the bright glory of God.

    2. With Him we on Zion shall stand,
    (For Jesus hath spoken the word) — 
    And all of Immanuel’s land,
    Survey in the sight of the Lord.183
    But when on His bosom reclin’d,
    His face we are strengthen’d to see, 
    Our joyfulness, Lord, we shall find, 
    Our heaven of heavens in Thee.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRfTXhN2kozzt9BbT9P6bEJqq7KofXwC/edit?mode=html)



    1. F rom Egypt lately come,
    Where death and darkness reign,
    We seek our new, our better home, 
    Where we our rest shall gain: 
    Hallelujah!
    We are on our way to God.

    2. To Canaan’s sacred bound
    We haste with songs of joy,
    Where peace and liberty are found, 
    And sweets that never cloy; 
    Hallelujah! &c.

    3. There sin and sorrow cease,
    And ev’ry conflict’s o’er;
    There we shall dwell in endless peace, 
    And never hunger more.
    Hallelujah! &c.

    4. There in celestial strains,
    Enraptur’d myriads sing,
    There love in every bosom reigns,
    For God Himself is king;
    Hallelujah, &c.

    5. We soon shall join the throng;
    Their pleasures we shall share,
    And sing the everlasting song,
    With all the ransom’d the re;
    Hallelujah, &c.

    6. How sweet the prospect is!
    It cheers the pilgrim’s breast;
    We’re journeying through the wilderness, 
    But soon shall gain our rest;
    Hallelujah 1 &c.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvlDVshYWiM1IWttgXxfHs7z1_M74bGW/edit?mode=html)



    1. W hen I behold the wondrous cross
    On which the Lord of glory died,
    My richest gain I count but loss,
    And pour contempt on all my pride.

    2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
    Save in the death of Christ, my God;
    All the vain things that charm’d me most, 
    I’ d sacrifice them to His blood.185

    3. By suffering there, beneath His feet
    He trod the fierce Avenger down; 
    There, power itself and weakness meet, 
    Emblems of each yon thorny crown!

    4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
    That were an off’ring far too small; 
    Love so amazing, so divine,
    Demands my soul, my life, my all.
 
 

## 185.  On earth the song begins.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQPH5EuXYhFUaHU4gXlDajLdmy0MlzBw/edit?mode=html)



    1. On earth the song begins;
    In heav’n more sweet and loud,
    “To Him that cleans’d our sins 
    By His atoning blood 
    “To Him,” we sing in joyful strain,
    “Be honour, pow’r, and praise, Amen.”

    2. Believers now repeat,
    What heav’n with gladness owns; 
    And while before His feet 
    The elders cast their crowns,
    Come, imitate the choirs above,
    And sing aloud the Saviour s love.

    3. Alone He bore the cross,
    Alone its grief sustain’d;
    His was the shame and loss,
    And He the vict’ry gain’d;
    The mighty work was all His own,
    Tho’ we shall share His glorious throne.
 
 

## 186.  Come let us sing the matchless worth
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHzh6GUTXymJlVp2eFIJ0FSkjZT61SWk/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come let us sing the matchless worth, 
    And sweetly sound the glories forth
    Which in the Saviour shine,
    To God and Christ our praises bring: 
    The song with which the heavens ring,
    Now let us gladly join.

    2. How rich the precious blood He spilt, 
    Our ransom from the dreadful guilt
    Of sin against our God;
    How perfect was His righteousness,
    In which unspotted beauteous dress,
    His saints have ever stood!

    3. How rich the character He bears,
    And all the form of love He wears,
    Exalted on the throne;187
    In songs of sweet untiring praise,
    We would, to everlasting days,
    Make all His glories known.

    4. And soon the happy day shall come, 
    When we shall reach our destin’d home, 
    And see Him face to face;
    Then with our Saviour, Brother, Friend, 
    The one unbroken day we’ll spend 
    In singing still His grace.
 
 

## 187.  Join all the glorious names.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHyBQNX2%2DK2zhSd6_zexihf8DjcnFRVa/edit?mode=html)



    1. Join all the glorious names
    Of wisdom, love, and pow’r,
    That mortals ever knew,
    That angels ever b ore;
    All are too mean to speak His worth, 
    Too mean to set the Saviour forth.

    2. Great Prophet of our God!
    Our tongues must bless Thy name, 
    By Whom the joyful news 
    Of our salvation came;
    The joyful news of sins forgiv’n,
    Of hell subdu’d, of peace with heav’n.

    3. Thou art our Counsellor,
    Our Pattern, and our Guide,
    And Thou our Shepherd a r t;
    Ah, keep us near Thy side;
    Nor let our feet e’er run astray,
    Or wander in the crooked way.

    4. We love Thy well-known voice,
    And trust Thine eye to keep 
    Our wand'ring souls among 
    The thousands of God’s sheep;
    Feed Thou His flock, call Thou their names, 
    And gently lead the tender lambs.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEBZ0TIXCG4ueQYUqNr8m4Wk1b83L9Mi/edit?mode=html)



    1. Should all the hosts of death,
    And pow’rs of hell unknown,
    Put their most dreadful forms 
    Of rage and mischief on,
    We shall be safe, while Christ displays 
    His guardian and Almighty grace.

    2. O Thou Almighty Lord!
    Hell’s conqueror and King,
    Thy sceptre and Thy sword,
    Thy love and grace we sing;189
    Thine is our pow’r, and we would sit,
    In willing bonds, close at Thy feet.

    3. Yet, help us now to rise,
    And tread the tempter down;
    O Jesus, lead us forth
    To conquest, and the crown;
    And feeble saints shall win the day, 
    Though death and Hell obstruct the way.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1urS4XtozBvrEGqiOIlp9eHClwoiybdeZ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, Saviour of the soul,
    Let us to Thy bosom fly,
    While the raging billows roll,
    While the tempest still is high;
    Hide us, O our Saviour, hide,
    Till the storm of life is past:
    Safe into the haven guide,
    There receive Thy church at last.

    2. Other refuge have we none,
    Helpless, hanging still on Thee; 
    Leave, O leave us not alone,
    Still our stay and comfort b e;
    All our trust on Thee is stay’d,
    All our help from Thee we b rin g; 
    Cover each defenceless head 
    With the shadow of Thy wing.

    3. Thou, O Lord, art all we want,
    Boundless love in Thee we find; 
    Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
    Heal the sick, and lead the blind. 
    Just and holy is Thy name,
    We are all unrighteousness;
    We are full of sin and shame 
    Thou art full of truth and grace.

    4. Plenteous grace with Thee is found
    Grace to pardon ev’ry sin;
    Let the healing streams abound, 
    Make and keep us pure within. 
    Thou of life the fountain art,
    Freely let us take of Thee;
    Spring Thou up within each heart, 
    Rise to all eternity.

    1. Since Thou, the everlasting God,
    Our Father art become;
    Jesus, our Guardian and our Friend, 
    And heav’n our final hom e;

    2. We welcome all Thy soVreign will,
    For all Thy will is love;191
    And when we know not what Thou dost, 
    We wait the light above.

    3. Thy gracious love in all our need 
    Shall heav’nly light im pa rt;
    And be our theme of endless praise, 
    When all things else depart.

    1. Christ deliver’d me when bound,
    And, when wounded, heal’d my wound, 
    Sought me wand’ring, set me right, 
    Turn’d my darkness into light.

    2. Can a mother’s tender care 
    Cease toward the child she bare?
    Yes, she may forgetful be,
    Yet will He remember me.

    3. His is an unchanging love,
    Higher than the heights above,
    Deeper than the depths beneath,
    Free and faithful, strong as death.

    4. I shall see His glory soon,
    When the work of grace is done,
    Partner of His throne shall b e;
    Such His wondrous love to me!

    5. This alone is my complaint,
    That my love is weak and fain t;
    Yet I love Him, and adore,
    O for grace to love Him more 1

    1. Happy Christian, God’s own child, 
    Chosen, call’d, and reconcil’d;
    Once a rebel full of taint,
    Now a duteous, humble saint.

    2. Happy Christian, look on high,
    See thy portion in the sk y;
    Fix’d by everlasting love,
    Who that portion can remove?

    3. Happy Christian, though the earth 
    Cannot know thy gracious worth,
    Yet thy God shall soon proclaim, 
    Through all heav’n, thy favour’d name.

    4. Happy Christian, angels say,
    “Turn thy heart from earth away,
    Leave the world and all its woes,
    Take with Christ thy sweet repose.”

    5. Happy Christian, onward fly,
    Rise, the kingdom now is nigh!
    When thou shalt, upon His throne,
    See what Christ has made thine own.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6%2D1eGJwlh%2D_zaP7YRIaIP9DNk6ZYZVj/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Jesus, to tell of Thy love
    Our souls shall for ever delight,
    And join with the blessed above 
    In praises by day and by night. 
    Wherever we follow Thee, Lord, 
    Admiring, adoring, we see 
    That love which was stronger than death, 
    Flow out without limit, and free.

    2. Descending from glory on high,
    With men Thy delight was to dwell, 
    Contented, our surety to die,
    By dying to save us from hell; 
    Enduring the grief and the shame,
    And bearing our sin on the cross,
    Oh 1 who would not boast of this love,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rOia3MZu5%2Dbw1A%2Da7_O%2DgLSt9vnDto9k/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy gracious presence, O, our God,
    Our ev’ry wish contains;
    With this, beneath temptation’s load, 
    The heart no more complains.

    2. This can our ev’ry care control,
    Gild each dark scene with light;
    This is the sunshine of the soul: 
    Without it all is night.

    3. O happy scenes of pure delight,
    Where Love’s full beams impart 
    Unclouded beauty to the sight,
    And gladness to the heart.

    4. Our place in those fair realms of bliss,
    Our spirits long to know;
    Our wishes terminate in this,
    Nor can they rest below.

    5. Nor do these wishes of the heart
    Seem foolish, Lord, to Thee;
    For thou hast said, that where Thou art, 
    There we shall ever be.195

    6. Thus can our cheerful spirits sing 
    The darkest hour away,
    And rise on faith’s expanded wing, 
    To everlasting day.
 
 

## 195.  'O Jesus Christ, the Saviour.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmJq7QpvPrFycsDJlRrfjPM5by6PBHkl/edit?mode=html)



    1. O J esu s Christ, the Saviour,
    We only look to Thee;
    ’Tis in Thy love and favour 
    Our souls find liberty.
    While Satan fiercely rages,
    And shipwreck oft we fear,—
    'Tis this our grief assuages 
    That Thou art always near.

    2. Yes, tho’ the tempest round us
    Seems safety to defy;
    Tho’ rocks and shoals surround us, 
    And swell the billows high— 
    Thou dost from death protect us, 
    And cheer us by Thy love;
    Thy counsels too direct us 
    Safe to the Rest above.

    3. There—with what joy reviewing 
    Past conflicts, dangers, fears,
    Thy hand our foes subduing,
    And drying all our tears,—
    Our hearts with rapture burning, 
    The path we shall retrace, 
    Where now our souls are learning 
    The riches of Thy grace.

    4. O then how loud the chorus 
    Shall to Thy name resound, 
    From all at rest before us,
    From all Thy grace hath found 1 
    One joyful song for ever 
    Each harp, each lip shall raise, 
    The praise of our Redeemer,
    Our God and Saviour’s praise.
 
 

## 196.  'How long, O Lord our Saviour'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rD29ecehDIeuYzXoXD0Kp9E39lWyZ1Zb/edit?mode=html)



    1. How long, O Lord our Saviour, 
    Wilt Thou remain away?
    Our hearts are growing weary 
    Of Thy so long delay;
    O when shall come the moment, 
    When, brighter far than morn, 
    The sunshine of Thy glory 
    Shall on Thy people dawn?196

    2. How long, O gracious Master,
    Wilt Thou Thy household leave? 
    So long hast Thou now tarried,
    Few Thy return believe: 
    Immers’d in sloth and folly,
    Thy servants, Lord, we see;
    And few of us stand ready 
    With joy to welcome Thee.

    3. How long, O Heav’nly Bridegroom,
    How long wilt Thou delay 1 
    And yet how few are grieving,
    That Thou dost absent stay:
    Thy very Bride her portion 
    And calling hath forgot,
    And seeks for ease and glory 
    Where Thou, her Lord, art not.

    4. O wake Thy slumbering virgins;
    Send forth the solemn cry,
    Let all Thy saints repeat it,
    “The Bridegroom draweth nighl” 
    May all our lamps be burning,
    Our loins well girded be,
    Each longing heart preparing 
    With joy Thy face to see.
 
 

## 197.  Once we all were wretched strangers.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rItc8YXJLRwoxBK%2DbgqdWxUcAhOoVWrJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Once we all were wretched strangers,
    All the enemies of G od;
    Heedless of our sins and dangers,
    On the brink of death we stood, 
    Nought deserving 
    But of wrath the fiery flood.

    2. Now our blinded eyes are waking,
    And our misery we se e;
    Now our stony hearts are breaking; 
    From eternal wrath we flee 
    • To the refuge,
    Open’d, Lamb of God, in Thee.

    3.’Twas Thy Love, O God, that knew us
    Earth’s foundation long before:
    That same love to Jesus drew us 
    By its sweet constraining pow’r, 
    And will keep us 
    Safely now, and evermore.

    4. God of love, our souls adore Thee!
    We would still Thy grace proclaim, 
    Till we cast our crowns before Thee, 
    And in glory praise Thy nam e; 
    Hallelujah!
    Be to God and to the Lamb.
 
 

## 198.  'When first, in purpose deep.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qyzC_hTIXmxFo_Qq3%2D0cH5IHQ_Lzebtf/edit?mode=html)



    “No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth 
    and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church.” Eph. 
    v. 28, 29.
    When first, in purpose deep,
    The Church was brought to view,
    In God’s eternal mind,—
    (Though none His counsel knew),
    The Father gave her to the Son,
    And He betroth’d her for His own.

    2. And though in Adam’s loins
    She brake His holy word;
    And, treach’rously untrue,
    Departed from her Lord:
    He brought her back, though hell withstood, 
    Wash’d from her sins in His own blood.

    3. Part of that church are we,—
    Whom He did thus redeem,
    Learning by daily proof 
    Our daily need of H im;
    Taught by the Spirit to confess 
    Jesus our only righteousness.

    4. Yea, more,—to crown the whole
    (His gracious plan to prove),
    Our union, found in Christ,
    Nor earth nor hell can move;
    Our daily boast and song is this—
    Jesus is ours, and we are His.

    5. Yes! we are one with Him
    ’Mid all our lep’rous sta te;
    And who was ever yet 
    Fain his own flesh to hate?
    " One spirit with the Lord! ” this proves— 
    In loving us Himself He loves.

    6. Nor can He cease to love;
    For His own precept is,
    “Ye husbands love your wives,”—
    And will not Christ love His?
    Will not He cherish and refresh 
    Bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh?

    7. Ah, ye s! Christ loves the church 
    ’Tis her He lives to bless;
    He cannot love her more,
    Nor will He love her less:
    Fair in His sight, cleans’d by the word,
    A bride adorn’d, meet for her Lord.
 
 

## 199.  'Thro'' the Holy Ghost it is'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUknyU8cO5HlT8iBA8KcYKlUdq9hBop7/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thro’ the Holy Ghost it is,
    Christ is ours, and we are H is;
    Earth and hell in vain combine,
    To dissolve this tie Divine.

    2. Since we ere the Father’s care;
    None beside need we to fear,
    Us to Jesus He hath giv’n,
    Sons of God, and heirs of Heav’n. ,

    3. In His death we met our doom,
    He our Shepherd is become;
    Strong in His full strength we stand, 
    None can pluck us from His hand.

    4. In this Shepherd’s love secure,
    To the end we shall endure,
    In His service onward go,
    Till we conquer ev’ry foe.
 
 

## 200.  The person of the Lamb
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXvBOF2KyJhCgoIxeyto60qDhJ7z8s1C/edit?mode=html)



    1. The person of the Lamb,
    Enfolding ev’ry grace,
    Once slain, but now alive again,
    In Heav’n demands our praise.

    2. Gladly of Him we sing,
    Since we with Him are dead;
    Our life is hid with Christ in God,
    In Christ the Church’s Head.

    3. A heav’nly calling this!
    It sounds thro’ earth abroad;
    For we, by faith, in H eav’n behold 
    The kingly priest of God.
 
 

## 201.  'Jesus, spotless Lamb of God.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4W5tfMDtvJbbqSOLmYMrn33uzBndnh4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jestjs, spotless Lamb of God,
    Thou hast bought us with Thy blood— 
    We would value nought beside 
    Jesus—Jesus crucified.

    2. We are Thine—and Thine alone,
    This we gladly, fully ow n;
    And, in all our works and ways,
    Only now would seek Thy praise.

    3. Help us to confess Thy name,
    Bear with joy Thy cross and shame; 
    Only seek to follow Thee,
    Though reproach our portion be.


    4. When Thou shalt in glory come, 
    And we reach our heav’nly hom e; 
    Louder still each lip shall own, 
    We are Thine, and Thine alone.
 
 

## 202.  'Well may we sing! with triumph sing.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYSrjUElqeoxXq_elxGMVLJk20r6FHpr/edit?mode=html)



    1. Well may we sing! with triumph sing
    The great Redeemer’s praise!
    The glories of the living God,
    Reveal’d in Jesu’s face.

    2. The Father’s love it was, that sought
    From Hell to set us free;
    That gave the Lamb, whose precious blood 
    Has seal’d our liberty.

    3. In Him we read the Father’s love,
    And find eternal peace;
    We meet our God in Jesus Christ,
    And fear and terror cease.

    4. Then gladly sing, and sound abroad
    The great Redeemer’s praise;
    The glories of the living God,
    The riches of His grace!
 
 

## 203.  God in the face of His dear Son
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRQuYzQpg_PlRtQxaUbS5dn4HlGhoOSO/edit?mode=html)



    1. God, in the face of His dear Son,
    Makes His eternal counsels known,
    There love in all its glory shines,
    And truth is drawn in fairest lines.

    2. The pris’ner there may break his chains, 
    The weary rest from all his pains;
    The captive feel his bondage cease,
    The mourner find the way of peace.

    3. There faith reveals to mortal eyes 
    A brighter world beyond the skies;
    There shines the light which guides our way 
    From earth to realms of endless day.

    4. May we find grace to know the Lord,
    To seek His glories in the word;
    Its truths with meekness to receive,
    And by its holy precepts live.
 
 

## 204.  'Come ye that know the Saviour''s name'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jK5WUgqFQCIrYWhjtxij6sb4KGBHcWhZ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, ye that know the Saviour’s name 
    And raise your thoughts above;205
    Let ev’ry heart and voice unite 
    To sing—that God is love.

    2. This precious truth His word reveals;
    And all His mercies prove—•
    Creation and redemption join 
    To shew—that God is love.

    3. His patience, bearing much and long,
    With those who from Him rove,
    His kindness when He leads them home, 
    Both mark—that God is love.

    4. The work begun is carried on
    By pow’r from heav’n above;
    And ev’ry step, from first to last, 
    Declares—th at God is love.

    5. O! may we all, while here below,
    This best of blessings prove,
    Till nobler songs in brighter worlds 
    Proclaim—th at God is love!
 
 

## 205.  Songs of praise the angels sang.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jCkl4EXpvT_TsRX4AEJK8BQ8_5CL%2DiJi/edit?mode=html)



    1. Songs of praise the angels sang,
    Heav’n with hallelujahs rang,
    When Jehovah’s work begun,
    When He spake, and it was done.

    2. Songs of praise awoke the morn,
    When the Prince of Peace was b orn; 
    Songs of praise arose, when He 
    Captive led captivity.

    3. Heav’n and earth must pass away,
    Songs of praise shall crown the day: 
    God will make new heav’ns and earth, 
    Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

    4. And must man alone be dumb,
    Till that glorious kingdom come?
    N o;—the church is call’d to raise 
    Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.

    5. Let the church then spend her breath, 
    Singing of the Saviour’s death;
    And no less, with heart and voice,
    In the Lamb’s new life rejoice.

    6. Learning thus by faith and love,
    Songs of praise to sing above;
    Soon this holy sweet employ 
    She in glory shall enjoy.
 
 

## 206.  'I''m not ashamed to own my Lord.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jDHsX7HUbTqCyHL_tTScQJGTLX1NmR_0/edit?mode=html)



    1. I’m not asham’d to own my Lord,
    Or to defend His cause;
    Maintain the honour of His word,
    The glory of His cross.

    2. Jesus, my God! I know His name,
    His name is all my tru st;
    He will not put my soul to shame,
    Nor let my hope be lost.

    3. Firm as His life His promise stands,
    And He can well secure 
    W hat I’ve committed to His hands, 
    ’Till the appointed hour.

    4. Then will He own my worthless name
    Before the Father’s face,
    And in the new Jerusalem 
    Give to my soul its place.
 
 

## 207.  Far from us be grief and sadness
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKaiolYH5HcMPKoIEr2bWEfPkwdntvgD/edit?mode=html)



    1. F a r from us be grief and sadness, 
    Farther still unhallow’d mirth; 
    Sons of God may sing with gladness, 
    Theirs are joys of heav’nly birth:
    Jesus owns them,
    He is Lord of heaven and earth.

    2. All the worldling’s mirth is madness,
    All his labour fruitless toil;
    ’Tis the saints that taste of gladness, 
    Tho’ the world their choice revile: 
    Sweet their portion,
    Life is in the Saviour’s smile.

    3. Once the world was all our treasure,
    Then the world our hearts possest; 
    Now we taste sublimer pleasure, 
    Since the Lord has made us blest: 
    We can witness,
    Jesus gives His people rest.
 
 

## 208.  'How great the privilege! how sweet.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYBUX6L1MTIFi56e2TfuaR8b_h_rzYIS/edit?mode=html)



    1. How great the privilege! how sweet,
    To sing of Christ, the Lord we own; 
    Who gives us hope that we shall sit 
    Ere long with Him upon His throne.

    2. Is any subject half so sweet,
    So various as the love of God?
    Is any other name so great,
    As His Who bore our heavy load? 

    3.’Tis this alone that suits lost man,
    That makes his opposition cease, 
    Beholding love’s amazing plan,
    He drops his arms and sues for peace.

    4.’Twas so with u s; we once were foes,
    Were foes to Him Who gave us breath: 
    But He, Whose mercy freely flows 
    Has sav’d us from eternal death.

    5. Of Him then let us speak and sing,
    Who soon in glory shall appear,
    And us in all that glory bring 
    His own peculiar throne to share.
 
 

## 209.  'Thou precious Saviour, Son of God.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSYxXwDSyP6_8MRtIKU0WocqQVoxTXbJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thou precious Saviour, Son of God,
    Fountain for guilt and sin,
    Sufficient ever is Thy blood 
    To cleanse and keep us clean.

    2. To us then still that blood apply,
    Till faith to sight improve;
    Till hope in full enjoyment die,
    And all our souls are love.
 
 

## 210.  Zion shall soon lift up her head.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jLqD11ecxBm4hF0RtJpDLYoA5Wu3c%2Dnz/edit?mode=html)



    1. Zion shall soon lift up her head,
    And, call’d by grace, arise at length; 
    From dust, and darkness, and the dead, 
    Zion shall rise in Jesus’ strength—

    2. Shall put her beauteous garments on,
    Salvation, praise, and righteousness: 
    And, through the world her glory known, 
    The heathen shall her God confess.

    3. An earthly sun no more her light;
    The clouded moon conceals her face: 
    Jehovah sheds His glory bright 
    On all her scorn’d and sinning race.

    4. Then shall her gates wide open stand,
    And she the hallow’d court prepare;
    For Gentile hosts in Judah’s land 
    Shall swell her praise and join her pray’r
 
 

## 211.  'Though we''re weary, heavy-laden.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ijy%2D1v4WNl2FhxL3xhXURAyi7hPZf7YF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though we’re weary, heavy-laden,
    Lost and ruin’d in the fall;
    God in Christ is our salvation,
    He to us is all in all:
    Not the righteous,
    Sinners Jesus came to call.

    2. And for us, though poor and wretched,
    (God’s redeeming love adore!)
    Jesus stands in heav’n a Saviour,
    Full of mercy join’d with pow’r;
    He is able,
    He is willing evermore.

    3. Conscience could not make us linger,
    Nor of fitness could we dream;
    All the fitness He requireth,
    Is that we have need of Him:
    Jesus gave us
    Free salvation in His name.

    4. See the Saviour high ascended,
    Pleads for us His precious blood; 
    On the Father’s grace depending,
    We, thro’ Him, the sons of God, 
    Trust in Jesus,
    Who alone the winepress trod.
 
 

## 212.  Glory to the Father give.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ibiyvgrr_bMyiQZnTj%2DzIxLHaMc4obM0/edit?mode=html)



    1. Glory to the Father give,
    God in Whom we move and live; 
    Children’s praise He loves to hear, 
    Children’s songs delight His ear.

    2. Glory to the First-born bring,
    Christ the Prophet, Priest, and King 
    Brethren, raise your sweetest strain 
    To the Lamb Who once was slain!

    ~~3. Glory in the Holy Ghost,
    Sent from heav’n at Pentecost;
    ’Tis thro’ Him alone we live,
    And the precious truth receive.~~

    ~~4. May this then our service be, 
    Glorying in the Trinity,
    For the Gospel from above,
    For the word that “God is love.”~~
 
 

## 213.  'Hail! Alpha and Omega hail!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idnZQdKoNAroUjI8tq6mtrc8MyRE_ALQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail! Alpha and Omega, hail!
    The First and Last to fa ith; 
    Securer of the Church’s hope,
    The Truth, the Life, the Path.214

    2. Hail! First and Last, the great I am,
    God of the world above 1 
    Increase each little spark of faith,
    Fill ev’ry saint with love.

    3. O let that faith which Thou hast taught,
    Be treasur’d in each breast;
    The evidence of joys unseen,
    The substance of our rest.

    4. Thus shall we go from strength to strength,
    From grace to greater grace;
    From each degree of faith move on,
    Till we behold Thy face.
 
 

## 214.  O render thanks to God above
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1imxxJz71_oLFKxcNso5Qdi_895aYFn42/edit?mode=html)



1\. O render thanks to God above,\
The fountain of eternal love;\
Whose mercy firm through ages past\
Hath stood, and shall for ever last.\
\
2. The Father's changeless love we sing,\
Blest fountain! whence our comforts spring:\
How great the depth, how high it flows,\
No saint can tell, no angel knows.\
\
3. Its length and breadth no eye can trace,\
No thought explore the bounds of grace:\
The love which sav'd our souls from hell,\
Transcends a seraph's tongue to tell.
 
 

## 215.  How precious is the book Divine.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1irpsnKXFHzTZdJuxDl3bE_HNRlX3t74t/edit?mode=html)



1\. How precious is the book Divine,\
By inspiration giv'n\
As a bright lamp its doctrines shine,\
To guide our souls to heav'n.\
\
2. It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts\
In this dark vale of tears;\
Life, light, and joy it still imparts,\
And quells our rising fears.\
\
3. This lamp, thro' all the tedious night\
Of life, shall guide our way;\
'Till we behold the clearer light\
Of an eternal day.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ihgqdRC5mJknzEhZOmnBQaFz0aACXVGl/edit?mode=html)



    1. Now, Lord, inspire each brother’s heart, 
    And teach his tongue to speak;
    Food to each hungring soul impart,
    And cordials to the weak.


    2. Yea, God of might, Thy Son reveal,
    And sovereign calling own,
    Where Thou hast deign’d to set Thy seal, 
    There make His glories known.

    3. And let Thy Spirit from above
    Teach us to love Thee more;
    Teach us Thy word, that we may love, 
    As we did not before.

    4. Furnish us all with light and pow’rs
    To walk in wisdom’s ways;
    So shall the benefit be ours,
    And Thine shall be the praise.
 
 

## 217.  'Let us love, and sing, and wonder.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2oh_VuwA82_IQyuhi0j3HhSbTqWnpMF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Let us love, and sing, and wonder—
    Let us praise the Saviour’s name;
    He has hush’d the law’s loud thunder, 
    He has quench’d mount Sinai’s flame; 
    He has wash’d us in His blood,
    He has brought us nigh to God.

    2. Let us love the Lord th at bought us,
    Pity’d us when enemies;
    Called us by His grace, and taught us, 
    Gave us ears, and gave us eyes;
    He has wash’d us in His blood,
    He presents our souls to God.

    3. Let us sing, though fierce temptation
    Threaten hard to bear us down;
    For the Lord, our strong salvation, 
    Holds in view the conqu’ror’s crown; 
    He Who wash’d us in His blood,
    Safe will bring us home to God.

    4. Let us wonder; grace and justice
    Join, and point to mercy’s store; 
    Christ hath died; in Him our tru st is;
    Justice smiles, and asks no m ore;
    He Who wash’d us in His blood,
    Has secur’d our way to God.
 
 

## 218.  Let us praise and join the chorus.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igMYLTc%2DPlwbptrETSQ%2DWWB79NIkFIL9/edit?mode=html)



    1. Let us praise and join the chorus 
    Of the Heav’nly Host on high, 
    Blest ensamples set before us,
    How their praises fill the sky! 
    Thou hast wash’d us with Thy blood, 
    Thou art worthy, Lamb of God.

    2. H ark! the name of Jesus sounded 
    Loud from golden harps above!
    Lord, we blush and are confounded, 
    Faint our praises, cold our love.
    Wash our souls and songs with blood, 
    For by Thee we come to God.

    Death and the curse shall reign no m ore; 
    But Adam’s race in Him shall boast 
    More blessings far than Adam lost.

    1. Behold! the mountain of the Lord
    In latter days shall rise,
    On mountain tops above the hills,
    And draw the wond’ring eyes.

    2. To this the joyful nations round,
    All tribes and tongues, shall flow;
    “Up to the hill of God,” say they,
    “And to His house we’ll go.”

    3. The beam that shines from Sion’s hill,
    Shall lighten ev’ry land;
    The King who reigns in Salem’s tow’rs 
    Shall all the world command.

    4. Among the nations He shall judge;
    His judgments truth shall guide:
    His sceptre shall protect the just,
    And quell the sinner’s pride.

    5. No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds
    Disturb those peaceful years;
    To plough-shares men shall beat their swords, 
    To pruning-hooks their spears.2 24

    6. No longer hosts encount’ring hosts,
    Shall crowds of slain deplore; 
    They hang the trumpet in the hall, 
    And study war no more:—

    To worship at His shrine;
    And, walking in the light of God,
    In all His grace to shine.
 
 

## 224.  To wait for that important day.

    1. To wait for that important day,
    When Jesus will His power display;
    Be this our one great care,
    To do His will, our business he re;
    No toil to shun, no danger fear,
    Resolv’d His cross to share.

    2. And though He should prolong His stay, 
    And sinners mock at the delay,
    His people need not fear;
    The man Who wore the crown of thorns, 
    Whose claim the world rejects and scorns, 
    In glory will appear.

    3. Bright angels shall attend their King, 
    And heav’n with acclamations ring,
    When Jesus comes with clouds;
    By faith we see the dazzling train;
    It seems to fill yon azure plain 
    With heav’n’s exulting crowds.

    4. In patience then we now may rest, 
    (Assur’d the Father’s time is best,)
    And all His word obey:
    For this we know, the day will come 
    When Jesus shall convey us home, 
    And all His pow’r display.

    1. Lo! what a glorious sight appears
    To our admiring eyes;
    The former seas have pass’d away,
    The former earth and skies.

    2. From heav’n the new Jerus’lem comes,
    Full worthy of its Lord;
    See all things now at last renew’d,
    And Paradise restor’d.226

    3. The God of glory down to men
    Removes His bless’d abode:
    He dwells with men, His people they,
    And He His people’s God.

    4. His gracious hand shall wipe the tears
    From ev’ry weeping ey e;
    And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears, 
    And death itself shall die.

    5. How long, dear Saviour, O how long
    Shall this bright hour delay?
    Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time,
    And bring the welcome day.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lzpO9MpgaHOaJ8NNzblPo9MP0lbxqrb6/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sweet to the saints it is to bring 
    Praise to Thy name, O God, and sin g;
    To show Thy love by morning light,
    And tell of all Thy truth by night.

    2. For they must triumph in Thee, Lord,
    And bless Thy works, and bless Thy word: 
    To them Thy works so brightly shine!
    So deep Thy counsels! so divine!

    3. But if the little they can know 
    Of Thee and Thine while here below, 
    Such triumph gives—what will it be 
    When face to face Thyself they see?

    1. Jesus, our Lord, our souls adore 
    Thy saving love, Thy saving power;
    And, to our utmost stretch of thought, 
    Hail the redemption Thou hast wrought.

    2. Perish each thought of human pride;
    Let God alone be magnified;
    His glory let the heav’ns resound, 
    Shouted from earth’s remotest bound'

    3. Saints, who above the glory know!
    And ye who taste His love below 1

    1. Let saints on earth their anthems raise, 
    Who taste the Saviour’s grace;229
    While they in heav’n proclaim His praise, 
    And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

    For man’s apostate race;
    Praise Him Who stoop’d to bleed and die, 
    And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

    3. We soon shall reach the blissful shore,
    And view His lovely face;
    His name for ever to adore,
    And own Him “Prince of Peace.”

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lKIcXQ7oYzkM9fM7b4hdUUDAxNn8_1KI/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, saints, and sing; dismiss your fear,
    And raise each drooping h ead;
    Come sing with all the ransom’d here 
    The Lamb that once was dead; 
    Salvation sing: no word more meet 
    To join to Jesus’ name!
    Let ev’ry thankful tongue repeat 
    Salvation to the Lamb!

    2. When we incurr’d the wrath of God,
    (Alas, what could we worse!)
    He came, and with His own life’s blood, 
    Redeem’d us from the curse:
    Salvation sing; no word more meet 
    To join to Jesus’ nam e!
    Repeat, ye ransom’d souls, repeat 
    Salvation to the Lamb!

    1. Of all the gifts Thy hand bestows,
    Thou Giver of all good!
    Not heaven itself a richer knows 
    Than the Redeemer’s blood.

    2. Faith, too, the blood-receiving grace,
    From the same hand we gain;
    Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
    The gift had been in vain.

    3. We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
    To Thee our all we owe;
    The precious Saviour, and the power 
    That makes Him precious too.

    The God of sov’reign love.2 Jehovah, great I am—
    The Lord our righteousness;
    We hail the blest triumphant name, 
    Our hope of endless bliss.

    3. To Thee our songs we raise,
    While in this weary land;
    And sing, while waiting for the joys 
    Which are at Thy right hand.

    4. Thou by Thyself hast sworn;
    We on Thine oath depend,
    That we ere long, by pow’r upborne, 
    Shall to the throne ascend,

    5. There, to behold Thy face,
    There, Thy vast love explore; 
    And sing the wonders of Thy grace 
    A sea without a shore.

    3. Revealer of the Father’s love,
    His glory and His pow’r; 
    Upholding all things now above,
    ’Till the appointed hour—

    4. Then when Thy foes are all subdued,
    And all Thy work complete,
    Thy praise shall be Thy people’s food, 
    Who in Thy presence wait.

    1. Thou great Redeemer, precious Lamb 1
    We love to sing of Thee;
    No m usic’s like Thy charming name, 
    Nor half so sweet can be.

    2. O let us ever hear Thy voice
    To us in mercy speak;
    And in our Priest will we rejoice 
    Thou great Melchisedec!

    3. Our Jesus shall be still our theme,
    While in this world we stay;
    We’ll sing our Jesus’ blessed name,
    When all things else decay.

    4. When we appear upon the cloud,
    With all the favour’d throng,
    Then will we sing more sweet, more loud, 
    And Christ shall be our song.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvIoWbG0aYgNuEki0yLs_r10GVNcjJZA/edit?mode=html)



    1. F orgiveness!’twas a joyful sound
    To us when lost and doom’d to die: 
    Publish the bliss the world around;
    And gladly shout it thro’ the sky.

    2. 'Twas the rich gift of love divine;
    ’Twas full, effacing ev’ry crime: 
    Unbounded shall its glories shine,
    And know no change, hy changing time.

    3. For this stupendous love of Heav’n,
    What grateful honours shall we show! 
    Where much transgression is forgiv’n,
    Let love with equal ardour glow.

    4. By this inspir’d, let all our days
    With ev’ry heav’nly grace be crown’d; 
    Let truth and goodness, pray’r and praise, 
    In all abide, in all abound.

    In the Father’s house above:
    And His righteousness we wear, 
    Lov’d with everlasting love.

    1. Sons of God, now raise your songs; 
    Praise to Jesus Christ belongs; 
    Glory to the Saviour’s nam e;
    His the Victor’s crown and fame.

    2. Sore the strife, but rich the prize; 
    Precious in the Victor’s eyes:237
    G lorious is th e w o rk achieved—
    Satan vanquish’d, saints reliev’d.

    3. Sing we then the Victor’s praise, 
    Wondrous in His works and ways;
    Bid Him welcome to the throne,
    He is worthy, He alone.

    4. Soon, the crown upon His brow,
    Every knee to Him shall bow;
    While the full creation sings,
    “Lord of lords ” and “King of kings!”
 
 

## 237.  Behold the glories of the Lamb.

    1. B ehold the glories of the Lamb
    Upon the Father’s throne! 
    Prepare new honours for His name, 
    And songs before unknown.

    2. Let elders worship at His feet,
    The church adore around,
    With vials full of odours sweet, 
    And harps of sweeter sound.

    3.- Now to the Lamb that once was slain 
    Be endless blessings paid:
    Salvation, glory, joy remain,
    For ever on His h ead!

    4. Thou hast redeem’d our souls with blood,

    1. In Him Whose presence gladdens heaven,
    We do, and will rejoice;
    How blest are they to whom’tis giv’n,
    To hear and know His voice.

    2. He might have left us to endure
    The wrath we seem’d to brave;
    Our case would then admit no cure,
    For who but He can save.

    3. But though resisted long, He strove;
    His purpose was to save;
    He show’d the greatness of His love,
    And though provok’d, forgave.239—2 40

    4. Then let us sing of grace alone,
    And magnify the name 
    Of Him Who sits upon the throne,
    And join to praise the Lamb.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxC0%2Da8yrjREKh3Y58YWxDqNIpRDlupd/edit?mode=html)



    1. It was for me the Lord did die,
    To clear me from all charge of sin;
    And, Lord, from guilt of crimson dye,
    Thy precious blood hath made me clean.

    2. And now Thy righteousness divine
    Is all my glory, all my trust;
    Nor will I fear, since that is mine,
    While Thou dost live, and God is just.
    f Clad in this robe how bright I shine! 
    Angels might covet such a dress; 
    Angels have not a robe like mine,
    A robe like Jesus’ righteousness.

    Who in Thee begin to liv e;
    Day and night they cry to Thee,
    “As Thou art, so let us be.”

    2. Fix, O fix each wavering mind,
    To Thy cross our spirits bind; 
    Earthly passions far remove, 
    Swallow up our souls in love.

    3. Dust and ashes though we be,
    Full of guilt and misery;
    Thine we are, Thou Son of God, 
    Take the purchase of Thy blood.

    4. Boundless wisdom, power divine, 
    Love unspeakable, are Thine; 
    Praise by all to Thee be given, 
    Sons of God, and hosts of heaven.2 4 2
 
 

## 242.  O teach me more of Thy blest ways
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJQigGVWYuMj8PBKNWEIukfQe%2D5S6Vmx/edit?mode=html)



    1. O teach me more of Thy blest ways,
    Thou Holy Lamb of G od!
    And fix and root me in Thy grace,
    As one redeem’d by blood.

    2. O tell me often of Thy love,
    Of all Thy grief and pain;
    And let my heart with joy confess, 
    From thence comes all my gain.

    3. For this, O may I freely count
    Whate’er I have but loss;
    The dearest object of my love, 
    Compared with Thee, but dross.

    4. Engrave this deeply on my heart
    With an eternal pen,
    That I may, in some small degree, 
    Return Thy love again.

    Thy word abide for ever sure.

    2. He sent His only Son
    To save us from our woe;
    From Satan, guilt, and hell,
    And ev’ry hurtful foe.
    Thy mercy, Lord, shall still endure, 
    Thy word abide for ever sure.

    3. Give thanks aloud to God,
    To God your praises bring,
    With all around His throne 
    His works and glories sing.
    His pow’r and grace are still the same, 
    Let endless praise exalt His name.

    1. Through waves, through clouds and storms
    God gently clears our way;
    We wait His tim e; so shall the night 
    Soon end in blissful day.

    2. He ev’ry where hath sway,
    And all things serve His might;2 4 4
    His ev’ry act pure blessing is 
    His path unsullied light.

    3. When He makes bare His arm,
    What shall His work withstand? 
    When He His people’s cause defends, 
    Who then shall stay His hand?

    4. We leave it to Himself,
    To choose and to command,
    With wonder fill’d, we soon shall see 
    How wise, how strong His hand.

    5. We comprehend Him not,
    Yet earth and heaven tell;
    God sits as sov’reign on the throne, 
    And ruleth all things well.

    6. Thou seest our weakness, Lord,
    Our hearts are known to T hee;
    O lift Thou up each sinking hand, 
    Confirm each feeble knee.

    7. And let us henceforth all
    Boldly Thy truth declare, 
    Confessing unto all we meet 
    Thy love and guardian care.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwb8gDlrtw7c9q8KT5u%2DPsEMe2c_JLtZ/edit?mode=html)



    1. God knew the church—unsought, He sought;
    Wondrous His love has been;
    With Jesus’ blood He sav’d and bought,
    And freed her from her sin.

    2. He keeps her now—securely keeps,
    Whatever foe assails;
    With vigilance that never sleeps,
    With pow’r that never fails.

    3. He gives her hope that she shall be
    Ere long with Him above;
    That she shall all His glory see 
    And celebrate His love.

    4. Then let us, while we dwell below,
    Obey the Father’s voice;
    To all His dispensations bow,
    And in His name rejoice.

    5. How sweet to hear Him say at last,
    “Ye blessed children, come,
    Sorrow and crying now are past,
    And heav’n is now your home.’’

    H ail! as our Father and our God!
    For we are Thine by sacred ties,
    Thy sons and daughters, bought with blood.

    3. Then, a h! to us this grace afford,
    That far from Thee we ne’er may m ove; 
    Our gu ard —the presence of the Lord,
    Our joy—the sense of pardoning love,

    4. For this will make our hearts rejoice,
    Turning to light our darkest days;
    And this will nerve each feeble voice,
    While we have breath to pray or praise.
 
 

## 247.  'And art Thou with us, gracious Lord.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oCsgin7NjshItBt3mbLLqAYoO7zXJ%2Dcj/edit?mode=html)



    1. And art Thou with us, gracious Lord,
    To dissipate our fear;
    Dost Thou proclaim Thyself our God,
    Our Father ever near?

    2. A father’s pity dost Thou feel
    For all Thy feeble sain ts;
    And in the tend’rest accents speak,
    To soothe their sad complaints?

    3. On this support our souls shall lean,
    And banish ev’ry care;
    The darkest path is cheer’d with smiles, 
    Since Thou art with us there.
 
 

## 248.  'That we are seen, O God, by Thee'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvUSv9gHsbyqBskKt_GF%2Daaa_WWYFCGs/edit?mode=html)



    1. That we are seen, O God, by Thee,
    This is our happy thoug ht;
    Presented faultless to Thine eye,
    And all our sins forgot.

    2. Each hour of joy, this is the light
    Which guides us in our ways;
    And in affliction’s midnight gloom 
    This truth its pow’r displays.

    3. Then boldly on thro’ life we’ll pass;
    And if we’re call’d to die,
    The valley’s shade we will not dread, 
    For Thou wilt still be nigh.
 
 

## 249.  'Our feeble pray''r we now present.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntugg0ToywQI4J4b9h3i1CjCBugSmSW4/edit?mode=html)



    1. Our feeble pray’r we now present
    Before the throne of grace;
    God of the fathers! be our guide 
    Through all the toilsome race.

    2. Through each perplexing path of life
    Our pilgrim footsteps guide;
    Save us each day from Satan’s wiles,
    And full escape provide.

    3. O spread Thine own protection round,
    Till all our wand’rings cease,
    And at our Father’s lov’d abode 
    We all arrive in peace!

    4. We ask through Him, by Whose kind hand
    Thine own were ever le d;
    Who in Thy presence stands confess’d,
    The Church’s glorious Head.
 
 

## 250.  '''Tis seldom we can trace the way.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nsMQk_t5qJJWMGrpFU3feXRByckWdMa3/edit?mode=html)



    1.’Tis seldom we can trace the way
    Where Thou, our gracious Lord, dost move; 
    But we can always surely say,
    That God is love.

    2. When fear its gloomy cloud will fling
    O’er earth—our souls to heav’n above,
    As to their sanctuary, spring,
    For God is love.

    3. When doubt hangs o’er our darken’d path,
    We’ll check our dread, each doubt reprove; 
    For here Thy church sweet comfort hath, 
    That God is love.

    4. Yes Thou art love—a truth like this
    Can ev’ry gloomy thought remove,
    And turn our tears and woes to bliss;
    Our God is love.
 
 

## 251.  'Thy brethren, Lord, so minded keep.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpNRon3Za9apbp%2DFnFDkp85PartyD1BQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy Brethren, Lord, so minded keep,
    That we know nought beside 
    Thee, Who wast slain us to redeem,
    Thee! Jesus crucified!

    2. O may we, Saviour, step for step,
    Bear Thee sweet company,
    So will whate’er we undertake 
    An act of worship be!

    3. May we to Thee in all our wants,
    Child-like, still closer fly,Directing still throughout our course,
    By faith to Thee the eye!

    4. Although but little we can do,
    Yet’tis our heart’s desire,
    To do whate’er will give Thee joy;
    No more do we require.
 
 

## 252.  'O Love divine! what hast Thou done?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nESIp2RbFOsEEALgpPe2NWo7O9jjqAYr/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Love divine! what hast Thou done?
    The Son of God His blood hath shed, 
    The Father’s co-eternal Son 
    Had all our sins upon Him laid;
    The Son of God for us hath died,
    Our Lord, our Life was crucified,—

    2. Was crucified for us in shame,
    To bring us, rebels, back to God;
    So we may glory in His name,
    For we are cleansed by His blood: 
    Pardon and life flow’d from His side, 
    When He, the Lord, was crucified.

    3. Then let us glory in the cross,
    And make it here our constant them e; 
    All things for Christ account but dross, 
    And give up all our hearts to Him.
    Of nothing speak or think beside,
    The Lord, Who here was crucified.
 
 

## 253.  Like sheep we went astray
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3tdd_411EdhYYPKvbyMtamtj_LgXzpc/edit?mode=html)



    1. Like sheep we went astray
    Far from the fold of God,
    Each wand’ring in a diff’rent way, 
    But all the downward road.

    2. How dreadful was the hour
    When God our wand’rings laid, 
    And did at once His vengeance pour, 
    Upon the Shepherd’s head!

    3. How glorious was the grace
    When Jesus suffer’d th u s;
    His guiltless life the Shepherd pays, 
    To give that life to us!

    4. His honour and His breath
    Were taken both away;
    Join’d with the wicked in His death, 
    And made as vile as they.

    5. Gladly He bow’d His head
    For us, the sons of men,
    That we by Him, the woman’s seed, 
    Might conquer death and pain.
 
 

## 254.  'The Lamb was slain! let us adore'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mugfy%2DWyOAsyBFgj%2D%2DWywCWiEjxg0aGr/edit?mode=html)



    1. T he Lamb was slain! let us adore,
    And joyfully His mercy own,
    And humbly now and evermore 
    Before His wounded feet fall down;
    Serve without dread, with rev’rence love 
    The Lord Whose boundless grace we prove.

    2. The Lamb was slain! both day and night
    The angelic choirs His praises sing;
    To Him enthron’d above all height,
    They round the throne their anthems bring; 
    As saints on earth we join the song,
    And praise Him tho’ with stamm’ring tongue.

    3. Gladly our own poor works we leave,
    For Him despise wealth, pleasure, fame, 
    To Him our souls and bodies give,
    Whose love doth our affections claim; 
    Henceforth we own Him as our Lord,
    Alone belov’d—alone ador’d.

    4. Through Him alone we live, for He
    Hath drowned our transgressions all 
    In love’s unfathomable sea:
    O love, unknown, unsearchable!
    The holy Lamb for sin was slain,
    That sinners endless life might gain.

    5. As ground, when parch’d with summer’s heat, 
    Gladly drinks in the welcome show’r,
    So would we, list’ning at His feet,
    Receive His words, and feel His pow’r; 
    Let nothing in our hearts remain 
    But this great truth, “The Lamb was slain! ”
 
 

## 255.  O Thou Whose mercies far exceed.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2oc9atPEgs%2DSIQAFNGz3BfSQt7SK6xJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Thou, W hose mercies far exceed
    All we can do or say,
    As in Thy people Thou indeed 
    Dost daily more display;
    Let, for our happiness, O God,
    On us while here below,
    By virtue of Thy death and blood,
    Thy richest blessings flow.

    2. Preserve Thy flock most graciously,
    Within Thy shelt’ring fold,
    Move them from ev’ry harm away,
    And in Thy safeguard hold;
    Till Thou shalt fully have obtain’d 
    In us the fruits of grace,
    And we, in joys that never end,
    Shall see Thee, face to face.

    3. O may the very God of peace,
    Us wholly sanctify,
    And grant us such a rich increase 
    Of unction from on high;
    That spirit, soul, and body may, 
    Preserved free from stain,
    Be blameless until Thy great day; 
    Lord Jesus Christ, Amen!
 
 

## 256.  O how the thought that I shall know.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjipXAC6q4yRwwMG2cJBgxwfTBYfUKf8/edit?mode=html)



    1. O HOW the thought th at I shall know 
    Jesus that suffer’d here below,
    >■ To manifest God’s favour,
    For me, and for the saints I love, 
    Both here, and with Himself above, 
    Doth my renewed nature move 
    At that sweet word, “For ever! ”

    2. For ever to behold Him shine!
    For evermore to call Him m ine!
    And see Him still before m e;
    For ever on His face to gaze!
    And meet His full assembled rays, 
    While all the Father He displays 
    To all the saints in glory!

    3. Not all things else are half so dear 
    As His delightful presence here,
    What must it be in heaven
    ’Tis heav’n on earth that we can say, 
    As now we journey, day by day,
    “Himself has borne our sins away, 
    Our sins are all forgiven.”

    4. But how will His celestial voice 
    Make each enraptur’d heart rejoice, 
    When we in glory hear H im!
    When we no longer at the gate,
    But in His blessed presence, wait, 
    When Jesus on His throne of state 
    Invites us to come near Him!
 
 

## 257.  Our times are in thy hand.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCqnxhriTcUmoIiXChTqm2y_1hyIRwHd/edit?mode=html)



    1. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Father, we wish them there;
    Our life, our soul, our all, we leave 
    Entirely to Thy care.

    2. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Whatever they may be,
    Pleasing or painful, dark or bright, 
    As best may seem to Thee.

    3. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Why should we doubt or fear?
    A Father’s hand will never cause 
    His child a needless tear.258

    4. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Jesus the crucified!
    The hand our many sins had pierc’d 
    Is now our guard and guide.

    5. Our times are in Thy hand,
    Jesus the Advocate!
    Nor can that hand be stretch’d in vain, 
    For us to supplicate.

    6. Our times are in Thy hand;
    We’ll always trust in Thee,
    Till we have left this weary land,
    And all Thy glory see.
 
 

## 258.  'Where high the heav''nly temple stands.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_kzpjqzl28ZTtHhyaMqG9uChAMaXrZF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Where high the heav’nly temple stands 
    The house of God not made with hands, 
    A great High Priest our nature wears, 
    And there before our God appears.

    2. He Who for us as surety stood,
    And pour’d on earth His precious blood, 
    Pursues in heav’n His gracious plan,
    The Saviour and the Friend of man.

    3. Though now ascended up on high,
    He bends on earth a Brother’s eye;
    Partaker of the human name,
    He knows the frailty of our frame.
    [ Our Fellow-suff’rer still retains,
    A fellow-feeling of our pains;
    And still remembers in the skies,
    His tears, and grief, and agonies.
    f> In ev’ry pang that rends the heart,
    The “Man of Sorrows ” had a p a r t:
    He knows and feels our every grief,
    And gives the suff’ring saint relief.

    6. With boldness therefore, at the throne,
    Let us make all our sorrows known;
    And seek the aid of heav’nly pow’r 
    To help us in each trying hour.
 
 

## 259.  'Hosanna! to the living Lord.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjnIeFp6NqPaBtgLLz1g81X9vSHR7awN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hosanna! to the living Lord;
    Hosanna! to th’ incarnate Word;
    To Christ, Creator, Saviour, King,
    Let earth, let heav’n, hosanna sing!

    2. Hosanna! Lord, Thine angels cry, 
    Hosanna! Lord, Thy saints reply;
    Above, beneath us, and around,
    We would that all should swell the sound.

    3. Assembled in Thy blessed name.
    Here we Thy parting promise claim, 
    Then, Saviour, with protecting care 
    Present to God our praise and prayer.
 
 

## 260.  To God the only wise.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n5H1Bo_GkSqPbnjpA8hXtETg0AAbEy1r/edit?mode=html)



    1. To God, the only wise,
    Father, and Son, we sing,
    And high enthron’d above the skies, 
    Praises to Them we bring.

    2.’Tis God’s eternal love,
    His counsel and His care,
    Preserve us safe from sin and shame, 
    And ev’ry hurtful snare.

    3. He will present His saints,
    Unblemish’d and complete,
    Before the glory of His face,
    With Him enthron’d to sit.

    4. Then all His chosen seed
    Shall meet around the throne,
    To bless the triumph of His grace, 
    And make His glories known,

    5. To our Redeemer, God,
    Almighty pow’r belongs;
    We soon shall reach His bless’d abode, 
    And shout triumphant songs.
 
 

## 261.  'To Thee, O gracious Lord, we give.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mfFdWNIa7EF3EpKLAT2QIp2WMaQGdfmY/edit?mode=html)



    1. To Thee, O gracious Lord, we give
    Our spirit, body, soul;
    Surcharge our hearts with love of Thee, 
    And baser loves control.

    2. Then will our converse be in heav’n,
    Thy praise our tongues employ;
    We shall forget all else but Thee,
    Our glory, crown, and joy.

    3. But oh 1 our Brother, Husband, Friend,
    We dread the things below,
    Lest they attempt to win our hearts, 
    And we our hearts bestow.

    4. Thou know’st us, fickle, foolish, frail,
    Inconstant as the air,
    Through Thee alone can we escape 
    Temptation’s constant snare.262

    5. Lord we look up, we turn to Thee,
    We seek Thy face above,
    Look, Lord, on us, and let us feel 
    Th’ omnipotence of love.
 
 

## 262.  Nothing on earth we call our own.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lASC6RTYyniy2cftMfSqN2Jq9wAj4CC1/edit?mode=html)



    1. Nothing on earth we call our own,
    As strangers to the world, unknown,
    W e’d all its joys despise;
    W e’d trample on its whole delight,
    And seek a city out of sight,
    A city in the skies.

    2. There is our house and portion fair,
    Our treasure and our hearts are there,
    And our abiding home;
    For us our martyr’d brethren stay,
    And angels call us hence away,
    And Jesus bids us come.

    3. “We come,”—Thy servants, Lord, reply, 
    “We come to meet Thee in the sky,
    And claim our heav’nly r e st;
    Soon let our toilsome journey end,
    For then, O Saviour, Brother, Friend, 
    With Thee we shall be blest.”
 
 

## 263.  Onward let my children go.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l3W27HqjWr4zv%2DiVJDf62uBTk1TJtE26/edit?mode=html)



    1. “Onward let My children go; ”
    Jesu’s God hath written so;
    Though the path be through the sea, 
    Little flock what’s that to thee?
    He Who bids thee pass the waters 
    Will be with His sons and daughters.

    2. Deep and wide the sea appears,
    Every soul is fill’d with fears—
    Yet the word is “Onward” still,—< 
    Forward move to do His will,
    Tho’ no way thou canst discover,
    Not one plank to float thee over.

    3. Art thou feeble, sorely tried?
    Art thou press’d on every side?
    Does it seem as if no pow’r 
    Could relieve thee in this hour?
    Wherefore art thou thus dishearten’d?
    Is the arm that sav’d thee, shorten’d?

    4. Stand thou still, and thou shalt see 
    Wonders wrought, and wrought for th ee; 
    Safe thyself, on yonder shore,
    Thou shalt see thy foes no more:264
    Thine to see the Saviour’s glory,
    Thine to tell a wondrous story.

    5. Trust thy Ged, and He’ll be known, 
    Far and wide, as God alone;
    At His feet thy fears shall fall,
    For thy God is Lord of a ll;
    Strength is His, and His salvation, 
    Make them both thy sure foundation.
 
 

## 264.  'Belov''d associates in the strife'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mf92OuT4sB317P8p9RYUdBARrntSb1BC/edit?mode=html)



    1. Belov’d associates in the strife
    That ends in perfect peace,
    A life of conflict is our life,
    FrtPtn war we must not cease.

    2. The soldiers of the cross must fight,
    Till life itself be p as t;
    The foe assails them day and night, 
    Assails them to the last.

    3. But let us still remember this,
    Though mighty are our foes,
    The Lord Who saves us, greater is 
    Than all who can oppose.

    4. We need not fly, we need not fear,
    Since He Who reigns above,
    In all our conflicts will be near 
    The people of His love.

    5. If thus we face the adverse pow’rs,
    If thus we meet the strife,
    The vict’ry always must be ours,
    And ours the crown of life.
 
 

## 265.  And do we hope to be with Him
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ksHjlTEJgfcweLrF0i%2Dv5K3IisJCO69y/edit?mode=html)



    1. And do we hope to be with Him,
    Who on the cross resign’d His breath, 
    Who died a victim to redeem 
    His people from eternal death?

    2. Then should the question oft recur,
    What do we more than others do?
    How do we show that we prefer 
    The things above to things below?

    3. Where is the holy walk that suits
    The name and character we bear?
    And where are seen those heav’nly fruits 
    That show we’re not what once we were?

    4. Allied to Him Who bore the cross,
    And call’d the people of the Lord,
    The world to us should seem but loss,
    And worthless all it can afford.

    5. As pilgrims on their journey home,
    ’Tis thus His people should be found, 
    Who seek a city yet to come,
    And cannot rest on earthly ground.

    6.’Tis thus His people prove their birth,
    ’Tis thus they glorify their Lord;
    To others they resign the earth,
    And hasten to their bright reward,
 
 

## 266.  If Jesus should appear.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpxjJXLBdsI9hbhsvRAGk6z%2DMXr839ZD/edit?mode=html)



    1. If Jesus should appear
    Now at this very moment,
    We have no cause to fear;
    No, but with deep abasement, 
    Joyful we would adore 
    The Lamb Who shed His blood, 
    And own Him evermore 
    Our Saviour, Lord and God.

    2. A h! might the time soon come,
    When Thou, our souls’ Belov’d, 
    Shalt take Thy brethren home,
    And shew them all approv’d; 
    When we shall all behold 
    Him Whom by faith we know, 
    Chief Shepherd of the fold,
    Saviour from ev’ry foe!

    3. Hear Thou Thy people’s cry,
    O Jesus, Christ and Lord,
    And bring that glory nigh 
    As promis’d in Thy w ord;
    And when Thou shalt assign 
    His lot to ev’ry one,
    Thy righteousness divine 
    Shall be our boast alone.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mN8h6O0q6TNqlXwudjo3QmWkFQVsh4AE/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ye servants of the L ord!
    Each in his office wait,
    Observant of His heavenly word, 
    And watchful at His gate.

    2. Let ev’ry lamp be bright,
    And trim each golden flame,
    Gird up your loins, as in His sight, 
    And called by His name.

    3. W atch!’tis your Lord’s command,
    And while we speak H e’s near, 
    Mark the first signal of His hand, 
    And ready all appear.

    4. O happy servant he,
    In such a posture found,
    He shall his Lord with rapture see, 
    And be with honour crown’d.268

    5. Christ shall the banquet spread 
    With His own bounteous hand, 
    And raise that fav’rite servant’s head 
    Amid the happy band.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mb0Ih8bLf7VXfnHXzZahXhQobhQlIQtY/edit?mode=html)



    1. Son of God, Thy people’s shield,
    Must we still Thine absence mourn? 
    Let Thy promise be fulfill’d,—
    Thou hast said “I will return.”

    2. Gracious Master, soon appear,
    Quickly bring Thy morning’s light, 
    Then will cease the constant tear,
    Hope be turn’d to joyful sight.

    3. As a woman counts the days
    Till her absent lord she see,
    Longs and watches, weeps and prays, 
    So the church must long for Thee.

    4. Come, that we may see Thee nigh;
    Then the sheep shall feed in peace, 
    Hush’d for ever trouble’s sigh,
    Sin and sorrow’s triumph cease.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIxM87xRnl57z0HAyWE6_2iTESPpgMI8/edit?mode=html)



    1. Long hath the night of sorrow reign’d,
    The dawn will bring us light;
    Christ shall appear, and we shall rise 
    With gladness at the sight.

    2. Then we shall see the blessed Lamb,
    Shall see Him and rejoice;
    His coming like the morning be,
    Like morning songs His voice.

    3. As dew upon the tender herb,
    Diffusing fragrance round,
    As show’rs that usher in the spring, 
    And cheer the thirsty ground;

    4. So shall His gracious presence bless,
    And give us joyful lig ht;
    That hallow’d morn will chase away 
    All sorrows of the night.

    1. O Saviour! Whom absent we love; 
    Whom not having seen we adore, 
    Whose name is exalted above 
    All glory, dominion, and pow’r.

    2. When that happy morning begins,
    When we in Thy glories shall shine,
    Nor grieve any more by our sins 
    The bosom on which we recline;

    3. O then shall the mists be remov’d,
    And round us Thy brightness be pour’d! 
    We shall meet Him, Whom absent we lov’d, 
    We shall see, Whom unseen we ador’d.

    4. And then never more shall the fears,
    The trials, temptations, and woes,
    Which darken this valley of tears,
    Intrude on our blissful repose.
 
 

## 271.  'Behold the saints belov''d of God'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0B2Nwp5yehqnCXeet6mryjgSqiZVzUb/edit?mode=html)



    1. Behold the saints belov’d of God,
    Who wash’d their robes in Jesu’s blood; 
    More spotless than the purest white,
    They shine in uncreated light.

    2. From tribulation great they came,
    They bore the cross and scorn’d the shame; 
    But now in joy unceasing rest,
    With God in glory fully blest.

    3. The cross has prov’d their endless gain; 
    With Jesus they’ll for ever reign;
    And seated on His throne, shall praise 
    The blessings of redeeming grace.

    4. Hunger they ne’er shall feel again,
    Nor burning thirst shall they sustain; 
    To wells of living water led,
    By God the Lamb for ever fed.

    5. Jesus, the Saviour, is their theme;
    They sing the wonders of His nam e;
    To Him ascribing pow’r and grace, 
    Dominion and eternal praise.

    6. “Amen!” they cry to Him alone,
    Once dead, now seated on His th rone; 
    To Him be glory, and again
    To Him be praise, “Amen! Amen 1”
 
 

## 272.  How bright these glorious spirits shine.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1grmmyhxXg6nvyKdkOSLTYTUc%2D0FLFCOh/edit?mode=html)



    1. How bright these glorious spirits shine, 
    Whence all their bright array!
    How came they to the happy seats 
    Of everlasting day?272

    2. L o! these are they from suff’rings great,
    Who came to realms of light,
    And in the blood of Christ have wash’d 
    Their robes, which shine so bright.

    3. Now with triumphant palms they stand
    Before the throne on high;
    And serve the Lord they love, amidst 
    The glories of the sky.

    4. His presence fills each heart with joy,
    And gives them pow’r to sing;
    While day, and night, the sacred courts 
    With glad hosannas ring.

    5. Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
    Nor sun with scorching ray;
    God is their sun, whose cheering beams 
    Give them eternal day.

    6. The Lamb, Who dwells amid the throne
    Shall o’er them still preside,
    Feed them with nourishment divine,
    And all their footsteps guide.

    7. Midst pastures green He’ll lead His flock,
    Where living streams appear,
    And God the Lord, from ev’ry eye 
    Shall wipe off ev’ry tear.
 
 

## 273.  Now may the God of peace and love.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLCppiMJLYpZ28KVrIu6qwvTQiTW2_7K/edit?mode=html)



    1. Now may the God of peace and love,
    Who, from the silent grave,
    Restor’d the Shepherd of the sheep, 
    Omnipotent to save,—

    2. Through the rich merits of that blood
    Which He on Calv’ry spilt,
    To make the gracious work secure,
    On which our hopes are built,—

    3. Perfect our souls in ev’ry grace,
    To do His blessed will,
    And all that’s pleasing in His sight 
    Inspire us to fulfil.

    4. For Him, our ris’n Shepherd’s sake,
    We ev’ry blessing p ray;
    With glory let His name be crown’d 
    Through heav’n’s eternal day.
 
 

## 274.  'Saviour and Lord, our Priest and King.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7G8gyTOibP3bnkawhjXCorBlruWwrap/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour and Lord, our Priest and King, 
    Who didst for our transgressions die, 
    Bearing our grief, that Thou miight’st bring 
    Pardon and immortality;

    2. Grant to our voice a seraph’s wing 
    To bear Thy praises up on high,
    Dominion, blessing, might, we’ll sing 
    To Thee, throughout eternity;
    Amen! Amen! Our God, Amen.
 
 

## 275.  The Lord is coming in the clouds.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gk6m6k2w9WT%2D47YJlT8_DnVNYT5ACAT4/edit?mode=html)



    1. The Lord is coming in the clouds,
    Is coming with angelic crowds,
    An universal shout shall rend 
    The air, and Jesus will descend.

    2. How grand the pomp of His descent,
    What glory waits on the ev ent!
    The glory that to heav’n belongs,
    Is His, and His the angels’ songs.

    3. Unlike to those who nothing see 
    Beyond the world, those men should be, 
    Who look for Jesus in the air,
    And know that they shall meet Him there.

    4. Their girded loins, and lamps of fire 
    Should tell what is their souls’ desire,
    To see the object of their love,
    And dwell with Him in heav’n above.
 
 

## 276.  'Jehovah Jesus! glorious Lord'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gS6aWdBcSvRcr1v7PtMl1lKA%2DnaK3bSy/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jehovah, Je sus! glorious Lord,
    We seek Thy Spirit with the word,
    For all Thy saints around:
    We seek for each of Thine now here,
    The seeing eye, the hearing ear,
    To know the joyful sound!

    2. Without a flowing stream of grace,
    To see God’s glory in Thy face,
    And manifest Thee, Lord;
    Our- meetings here must barren prove 
    Not one can taste the father’s love,
    Or savour of the word.

    3. The Holy Ghost, in blessing thus,
    Must take of Thine and shew to us,
    Thine own and God’s im part;
    And He no less the same must prove, 
    And shed abroad the Father’s love,
    In each renewed heart;

    4. Yet Lord! Thy grace we dare not bound: 
    Near to Thyself we’ve always found
    The Holy Ghost is ours:
    Thy Person is the blessed clue 
    To all who would the Father view 
    And know the Spirit’s powers.

## 277.  'Shepherd of life! do Thou behold'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5b9XRtiysyu9MIX9Y_cTn6BhXHWaB0h/edit?mode=html)



    1. Shepherd of life! do Thou behold 
    The little ones within the fold,
    With special grace, this day;
    That all God’s children giv’n to Thee, 
    May have their portion full and free, 
    And none go lean away.

    2. That fully taught, we all may boast 
    In Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
    For this to us is giv’n;
    That each may say, in godly fear,
    “Rejoice, ye saints, the Lord is near,
    He’ll quickly come from heav’n.”
 
 

## 278.  How precious that truth to the soul.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gwNArVNINr89eBRBzVZswM_M_68tcFdS/edit?mode=html)



    1. How precious that truth to the soul,
    “That Christ and His people are one 
    He life-giving Head to the whole,
    They members, and bone of His bone.

    2. An union so firm and so sure,
    Will bear the severest review,
    In Jesus the whole is secure,
    And nothing its bands can undo.

    3. This union assures us of bliss,
    Secur’d in the Head of all pow’rs; 
    We’ve portion in all that is His,
    And Jesus in all that is ours.

    4. Hence the church, tho’ by nature so mean
    (In itself it is nothing but sin),
    In Jesus is perfectly clean,
    And holy and righteous in Him.
 
 

## 279.  How wondrous the glories that meet.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gnGNowcwvl37HHu57Fdzzon8vOZsY2w%2D/edit?mode=html)



    1. How wond’rous the glories that meet
    In Jesus, and from His face shine!
    His love is eternal and sweet,
    ’Tis human,’tis also divine!

    2. His glory—not only God’s Son—
    In manhood He had His full part,— 
    And the union of both joined in one, 
    Form the fountain of love in His heart.

    3. Ye wash’d in the blood of the Lamb,
    Remember, when sorrows press sore, 
    Your Jesus did once feel the same,
    When conflicts and trials He bore.280

    4. Your Jesus both knows and hath felt,
    What marks all our sorrows and fears, 
    Since here in the flesh He once dwelt,
    And offer’d strong crying and tears.

    5. And we, as redeemed, well know,
    This Jesus the same in His lov e;
    The feet cannot suffer below,
    And the Head be unconscious above!

    6. And all that He has, He will use,
    For the Church’mid her sorrows and woes, 
    While the truth of His God she pursues,
    Nor aught of His conflict foregoes.

    7. The merits and worth of His blood,
    Have rais’d us from hell and from fear, 
    That we as the blest sons of God,
    Might make His good pleasure our care

    8. O then may this union and love
    Make us walk in the service of Heaven, 
    Mid’ obedience and suff’ring to prove 
    That we to the Lamb had been giv’n.
 
 

## 280.  Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggY3ZK%2D2tsRx67nkEjyyqkOzyPEt3gWE/edit?mode=html)



    1. W orthy the Lamb for sinners slain 
    (Cry the redeem’d above),
    Blessing and honour to obtain,
    And everlasting love.

    2. Hail! Hallelujah! power and praise 
    To God in Christ be given!
    May all who now this anthem raise 
    Renew the strain in heaven!
 
 

## 281.  'Jesus, Thou source of true delight.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzQHo_P8GskE3zgHO8fbEygUkOyGBc5e/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, Thou source of true delight,
    Whom we unseen adore,
    Unveil our souls to all Thy light,
    That we may love Thee more,

    2. Thy glory o’er creation shines;
    But in the sacred Word 
    We read in fairer, brighter lines,
    The glories of our Lord.

    3.’Tis here, whene’er our comforts droop
    And sins and sorrows rise,
    Thy love with cheerful beams of hope 
    Each fainting heart supplies.

    4. Jesus, our Lord, our Life, our Light,
    O come with blissful ray:
    Break through the gloomy shades of night, 
    And bring the look’d for day.282

    5. Then shall each soul with rapture trace 
    The wonders of Thy love;
    And the full glories of Thy face,
    As known to those above.
 
 

## 282.  'Why those fears? behold ''tis Jesus.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jqu_EKClyP_qlf%2DXdRTrsFAqo1Zzk6AF/edit?mode=html)



    1. W hy those fears? behold’tis Jesus 
    Holds the helm, and guides the ship; 
    Spread the sails, and catch the breezes 
    Sent to waft us through the deep,
    To the regions
    Where the mourners cease to weep.

    2. Could we stay where death is hovering? 
    Could we rest on such a shore?
    No; the awful truth discovering,
    We could linger there no m ore;
    We forsake it,
    Leaving all we lov’d before.

    3. Though the shore we hope to land on, 
    Only by report is known,
    Yet we freely all abandon,
    Led by that report alone,
    And with Jesus,
    Through the trackless deep move on.

    4. Led by that, we brave the ocean;
    Led by that, the storm defy;
    Calm amidst tumultuous motion, 
    Knowing that our Lord is nigh: 
    Waves obey Him,
    And the storms before Him fly.

    5. Render’d safe by His protection,
    We shall pass the wat’ry waste 
    Trusting to His wise direction,
    We shall gain the port at la st;
    And with wonder,
    Think on toils and dangers past.

    6. O what pleasures there await us!
    There the tempests cease to roar: 
    There it is that those who hate us 
    Can molest our peace no more: 
    Trouble ceases
    On th at tranquil, happy shore.
 
 

## 283.  'To those who love Thee, gracious Lord.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jsm3cf6KQahggQltcCJcoNRU7Vo2rhTj/edit?mode=html)



    1. To those who love Thee, gracious Lord, 
    How bright, how precious is the Word, 
    By God in mercy given,
    A guide to all who, travelling here 
    Mid sin and darkness, death and fear, 
    Are pressing on to heaven.

    2. O gracious Saviour, God of love,
    Aid Thine own Spirit from above,
    And fill us with desire 
    To read, to mark, to learn Thy will,
    And with Thy truth our spirits fill,
    And touch our hearts with fire.

    3. And till in glory Thou dost come 
    To take Thy waiting people home,
    With those at Thy right hand;
    E’en till that great and dreadful day, 
    When heaven and earth shall pass away, 
    May we in service stand!
 
 

## 284.  'Look, look, ye saints, within the veil.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjXJqmmr%2DHdFDq_Gk1g%2DW0G39mAnD_Lu/edit?mode=html)



    1. Look, look, ye Saints, within the veil
    To Jesus raise your song,
    Your joys can never, never fail,
    For you to Him belong.

    2. O happy saints, for ever freed
    From guilt, and every care;
    Dwell, dwell with your exalted Head,
    And let your life be there.

    3. And glory in your conq’ring God;
    See, see Him as He is;
    Your robes are spotless through His blood, 
    Your happiness is His.

    4. O think not of this world of woe,
    Though subject I till to grief;
    But seek your portion there to know,
    For this will give relief.

    5. Aye trust, for ever trust in God,
    For ev’ry promise giv’n;
    And dwell with Him through Jesu’s blood, 
    Within the veil of heav’n.
 
 

## 285.  'Thou hidden love of God, whose height.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jri7W6QxD8BwpVU7SPU2u%2DpwgdNlW26a/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thou hidden love of God, Whose height, 
    Whose depth unfathom’d no man knows, 
    I see from far Thy beauteous light,
    And gladly seek in it repose;
    That thus my heart from earth set free, 
    May find its whole delight in Thee!

    2. O crucify this self, that I
    No more, but Christ in me may liv e; 
    And bid each vile affection die,
    Nor let one hateful lust survive;
    In all things nothing may I see, 
    Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.
 
 

## 286.  'Jesus, Thy boundless love to me.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kKE0BTpsZFNkAMh9llaBmLzeIV3K8Jqh/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
    No thought can reach, no tongue declare; 
    Then bend my wayward heart to Thee,
    And reign without a rival there:
    Thine, wholly Thine, alone I’d live;
    Myself to Thee entirely give.

    2. O Lord, how cheering is Thy way!
    How blest! how gracious in mine eyes! 
    Care, anguish, sorrow, pass away,
    And fear before Thy presence flies 
    O Jesus, nothing may I see,
    Nothing desire, or seek but Thee!

    3.’Mid conflict be Thy love my peace!
    In weakness be Thy love my strength 1
    And when the storms of life shall cease, 
    And Thou to earth shalt come at length, 
    Then to Thy glory be my Guide,
    And show me Him Who for me died.
 
 

## 287.  Ye saints attend the cry
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jcsWXdlyRvDVdqc0142St5bA7tsHffBN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ye saints, attend the cry!
    Attend the trumpet’s sound: 
    Stand to your arms, the foe is nigh, 
    And pow’rs of hell are round.

    2. Consider Christ, your Head—
    Your Captain’s footsteps see; 
    Follow the Saviour, and be led 
    To certain victory.

    3. All pow’r to Him is giv’n—
    He ever reigns the same; 
    Salvation, happiness, and heav’n, 
    Are yours in Jesu’s name.

    4. Our Captain leads us on;
    He beckons from the skies;
    He reaches out the starry crown, 
    And bids us take the prize.288

    5. We bow to His command,
    Our arms and hearts prepare; 
    And firmly in the battle stand, 
    To wage a glorious war.
 
 

## 288.  Thou very present aid.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jZP4wL51cdpfGVzRbhdDe%2DW_lMwCLxNg/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thou very present aid,
    In sufFring and distress,
    The soul, which still on Thee is staid, 
    Is kept in perfect peace.

    2. Calmly the heart reclin’d
    By faith on Jesu’s breast 
    In deepest woe exults to find 
    A sweet eternal rest.

    3. Jesus, to Whom we fly,
    Does all our wishes fill,
    In vain the creature-streams are dry, 
    We have a Fountain still.

    4. Bereav’d of earthly friends,
    We find them all in One!
    And peace, and joy, that never ends, 
    And heaven—in Christ alone!
 
 

## 289.  'From earth the Saviour''s gone'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkwBs1i%2DMcvc0O1uBpPYEOiRj%2D5_h8Ul/edit?mode=html)



    1. From earth the Saviour’s gone,
    And stands before our God;
    And sprinkled now is all the throne, 
    With His atoning blood.

    2. No fiery vengeance now,
    No burning wrath comes down, 
    Where Justice calls for sinners’ blood, 
    The Saviour shews His own.

    3. Then may our joyful tongues
    Our Maker’s praises sing;
    Jesus, the Priest, receives our songs, 
    And bears them to the King.

    4. We bow before His face,
    And sound His glories hig h;
    “Hosanna to the God of grace,
    That brought the guilty nigh.”

    1. Joy to the world 1 the Lord is come! 
    Let earth receive her K ing;
    Let every heart prepare Him room, 
    And all creation sing.291

    2. Ye saints rejoice; the Saviour reigns!
    Let praise your tongues employ; 
    Floods, clap your hands; exult, ve plains, 
    And shout, ye hills, with joy!

    3. No more shall sins and sorrows grow,
    Nor thorns o’erspread the ground;
    He comes to make His blessings flow,
    Far as the curse is found.

    4. Joy to the world! the Lord is come!
    Let earth receive her King;
    Let every heart prepare Him room,

## 291.  Soon righteousness shall come
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kY%2DqzP_ZxmWzfKPpZmGOXpyYYmkJ%2DfrU/edit?mode=html)



    1. Soon righteousness shall come,
    And dwell on earth again:
    Jesus Jehovah be the King,
    And o’er the nations reign.

    2. Jesus Himself shall rule,
    The world shall hear His word;
    By one bless’d name shall He be known,— 
    The Universal Lord.
 
 

## 292.  From all that dwell below the skies.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khdguAsapa5KXZFUpiuCqI5bjfGUUUJp/edit?mode=html)



    1. From all that dwell below the skies,
    Let the Creator’s praise arise;
    Let the Redeemer’s name be sung,
    Through ev’ry land, by ev’ry tongue.

    2. Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord!
    Eternal truth attends Thy W ord;
    Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
    ’Till suns shall rise and set no more.
 
 

## 293.  Who trust unto the Lamb.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXt0Fait3HBXZr3zU05puch9gTC66Nev/edit?mode=html)



    1. Who trust unto the Lamb,
    Whom we in heaven see,
    Are cleans’d by blood from guilt and shame, 
    From condemnation free.

    2. In counsels deep of old,
    The sons of God they were;
    And all the lambs of Jesu’s fold 
    Were blest in Jesus there.

    3. This union ne’er shall break,
    Though earth’s strong columns bow;
    The strong, the tempted, and the weak,
    Are one in Jesus now.294

    4. Then, saints, erect your heads,
    You’re form’d in Christ anew;
    And tho’ thro’ earth destruction spreads, 
    No danger reaches you.

    5. Should storms of trouble rise,
    Or deadly foes assail;
    Your anchor safe on Jesus lies,
    Your hope’s within the vail.
 
 

## 294.  'Awake, prophetic harp, awake!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khlOOH7z3CHwfIHjqkcFCFmCJUOYM4DR/edit?mode=html)



    1. Awake, prophetic harp, awake!
    Retune thy strings for Jesus’ sake;
    We sing the Saviour of our race,
    The Lamb, our shield and hiding-place.

    2.’Tis He, the Lamb, to Him we fly, 
    W’hile the dread tempest passes b y;
    God sees His Well-beloved’s face,
    And spares us in our hiding-place.

    3. Thus, while we dwell in this blest scene, 
    The Lamb is our unfailing screen;
    To Him, though guilty, still we run, 
    And God still spares us for His Son.

    4. While yet we sojourn here below,
    Pollutions still our hearts o’erflow;
    A fali’n, abject, sentenc’d race,
    We deeply need a hiding-place.

    5. But pure, immortal, sinless, free,
    We, through the Lamb, at length shall b e; 
    Shall meet the Father face to face,
    And need no more a hiding-place.
 
 

## 295.  'Though dark be our way, since God is our guide'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k_vcOd1OZYv8cfW9JGY5GYkxENz6ZwPY/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though dark be our way, since God is our Guide,
    ’Tis ours to obey;’tis His to provide:
    Tho’ cisterns be broken, and creatures all fail, 
    The Word He hath spoken shall surely prevail.

    2. His love in time past forbids us to think 
    He’ll leave us at last in trouble to sink:
    The Lamb in His glory is ever in view,
    The pledge and the proof He will help us quite through.

    3. And since all we meet must work for our good,
    The bitter is sweet, the med’cine is food;
    Though painful at present,’twill cease before long,
    And then, how triumphant the conqueror’s song!
 
 

## 296.  Our Father we believe.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kYLwPDA09Fu1_IU7OBNg1pUE_nbFTkPN/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ouk Father! we believe,
    And trust Thy firm resolve:
    The Son has surely done the work,
    That did on Him devolve.

    2. His work is all complete—
    Salvation is secure:
    The merits of His life and death,
    Eternally endure.

    3. The proof is fix’d in heaven,
    High on Thy glorious thron e;
    For Jesus sits beside Thee now,
    Because Thy will is done.
 
 

## 297.  'O Love divine, how sweet Thou art'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kUPwJ1hgL_lRy0AnEM3D%2Do7ChCpMpIZ4/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Love divine, how sweet Thou art, 
    When shall I find my longing heart 
    All taken up by Thee?

    2.96—297
    O may I pant, and thirst to prove 
    The greatness of redeeming love,
    The love of Christ to m e!

    2. God only knows the love of God,
    O that it were more shed abroad
    In each poor longing he art!
    For love I’d sigh, for love I’d pine; 
    This only portion, Lord, be mine,
    Be mine, this better part 1

    3. O that I may for ever sit
    Like Mary, at the Master’s feet!
    Be this my happy choice;
    My only care, my only bliss,
    My joy, my heav’n on earth be this, 
    To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.

    4. O that I may, like favor’d John, 
    Recline my wearied soul upon
    The dear Redeemer’s breast; 
    From care and sin, and sorrow free, 
    Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee, 
    My everlasting rest!298—299
 
 

## 298.  O may we always ready stand.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXGJeTkFvspHNhYabR5GxOqsBqem9rOx/edit?mode=html)



    1. O may we always ready stand,
    With our lamps burning in the hand;
    May we in sight of heaven rejoice,
    Until we hear the Bridegroom's voice!

    2. Shine on us, Lord; new life im part;
    Fresh ardour kindle in each he art:
    And make Thine own all-quick’ning light 
    Dispel the sloth and clouds of n igh t!
 
 

## 299.  Had we ten thousand gifts beside.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiag_gHSDNbDRWwATx6fOBv1XPec7rJg/edit?mode=html)



    1. H ad we ten thousand gifts beside,
    We’d cleave to Jesus crucified,
    And build on Him alone;
    For no foundation is there given,
    On which to place our hopes of heaven, 
    But Christ, the corner-stone.

    2. Possessing Christ, we all possess, 
    Wisdom, and strength, and righteousness,
    And sanctity complete.
    Bold in His name, we dare draw nigh, 
    Before the Ruler of the sky,
    And all His justice meet.
 
 

## 300.  'O Jesus, gracious Saviour.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQ1QM284ERb3n89psyz6f7_Q%2DOSXQn2I/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Jesus, gracious Saviour,
    Upon the Father’s throne,
    Whose wond’rous love and favour 
    Have made our cause Thine own; 
    Thy people to Thee ever 
    For grace and help repair,
    For Thou they know wilt never 
    Refuse their griefs to share.

    2. O Lord, through tribulation
    Our weary journey lies,
    Through scorn and sore temptation, 
    And watchful enemies;
    ’Midst never-ceasing dangers 
    We through the desert roam,
    As pilgrims here and strangers,
    We seek the rest to come.

    3. O Lord, Thou too once hasted
    This weary desert through,
    Once fully tried and tasted 
    Its bitterness and woe;
    And hence Thy heart is tender,
    In truest sympathy,301
    Though now the heavens render 
    All praise to Thee on high.

    4. O by Thy Holy Spirit 
    Reveal to us Thy love,
    The joy we shall inherit
    With Thee, our Head above:
    May all this consolation
    Our trembling hearts sustain— 
    Sure—though through tribulation— 
    The promis’d rest to gain.
 
 

## 301.  'O Lord, when we the path retrace.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwaggqPRZNSq4N7HZNUnArS93Ko_LAI6/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Lord, when we the path retrace
    Which Thou on earth hast trod,
    To man Thy wond’rous love and grace, 
    Thy faithfulness to God.

    2. Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
    Prov’d stronger than the grave;
    The very spear that pierced Thy side 
    Drew forth the blood to save.

    3. Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
    ’Midst darkness only light,
    Thou didst Thy Father’s name confess, 
    And in His will delight.

    4. Unmoved by Satan’s subtle wiles,
    Or suffering, shame and loss,
    Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles, 
    Led only to the Cross.

    5. O Lord, with sorrow and with shame,
    We meekly would confess,
    How little we who bear Thy name, 
    Thy mind, Thy ways express.

    6. Give us Thy meek, Thy lowly mind,
    We would obedient be,
    And all our rest and pleasure find 
    In learning, Lord, of Thee.
 
 

## 302.  There is a place of endless joy.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkQqGVjGiDF0lZ9MvfoxRmS0qQN6kLB5/edit?mode=html)



    1. There is a place of endless joy 
    Prepar’d for saints above,
    Of peace and bliss without alloy,
    A heav’n of perfect love:
    It was for this that Jesus died,
    That we with Him might there abide;
    It was for this He suffer’d pain,
    That all His saints might with Him reign.

    2. How bright, how holy is the place,
    Unfading, undefiled,
    Where God unveils His smiling face 
    On Jesus His beloved Child—
    They round the throne triumphant stand, 
    A golden harp in ev’ry hand,
    To which they sing the ceaseless strain:
    “Worthy the Lamb, for sinners slain 1”

    3. O wondrous grace! O love divine!
    To give us such a hom e!
    Let us the present things resign,
    And seek this Rest to come—
    And gazing on our Saviour’s cross, 
    Esteem all else but dung and loss;
    Press forward till the race be run,
    Fight till the crown of life be won.
 
 

## 303.  'Lord, we are Thine: our God Thou art'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_LIXr08hw%2D33ZZMHiBcPX9XSRwkWYC7/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord, we are Thine: our God Thou art, 
    Fashioned and made we are by Thee—
    These curious frames!—in ev’ry part,
    Thy wisdom, power, and love we see,— 
    Each breath we draw, each pulse that beats, 
    Each organ formed by skill divine,
    Each precious sense aloud repeats—
    Great God, that we are only Thine.

    2. Lord, we are Thine: in Thee we live,
    Supported by Thy tender care,
    Thou dost each hourly mercy give •
    Thine earth we tread, we breathe Thine air; 
    Raiment and food Thy hands supply;
    Thy sun’s bright rays around us shine; 
    Guarded by Thine all-seeing eye—
    We own, that we are only Thine.

    3. Lord, we are Thine: bought by Thy blood,
    Once the poor guilty slaves of sin,
    But Thou redeemedst us to God,
    And mad’st Thy Spirit dwell within;
    Thou hast our sinful wand’rings borne,
    With love and patience all divine;
    As brands, then, from the burning tom,
    We own that we are wholly Thine.

    4. Lord, we are Thine: Thy claims we own—
    Ourselves to Thee we wholly give;304-
    Reign Thou within our hearts alone,
    And let us to Thy glory live;
    Here let us each Thy mind display,
    In all Thy gracious image shine;
    And haste that long expected day,
    When Thou shalt own that we are Thine.
 
 

## 304.  'Come, saints, praise the Lamb, His mercies proclaim'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ztHoxI5exdzTM6b37IYMwZMj13FqQowt/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come, saints, praise the Lamb, His mercies
    proclaim,
    And lift up your heads, and sing of His name; 
    His love to the Church, which He purchased 
    with blood,
    To make her His Bride and the Temple of 
    God.

    2. When wand’ring far from the Father’s abode, 
    The "heart full of pride, and hatred to God, 
    The children of darkness, of Satan the slaves, 
    'Tis Jesus redeem’d us—His merit that saves.

    3. Our sins on the cross He on Calv’ry bore, 
    He blotted them out, and they are no more;
    Now pardon’d and washed, we spotless ap
    pear,
    And cry “Abba F a ther!” unhinder’d by fear.

    4. Despised by the world, we’re strangers be low,
    But called to heav’n, we cheerfully g o;
    The Lord is our Leader; and, strong in His might,
    Tho’ Satan opposes, we’ll fight the good fight.

    5. We look for the day when Jesus shall come, 
    And fetch all His blood-purchas’d brethren home;
    When we shall behold all His glory and grace,
    And a heav’n be found in the light of His face.
 
 

## 305.  'When along life''s thorny road.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z_jbo5%2DCNNTB8xC9mzA_I68OmnUShYpd/edit?mode=html)



    1. W hen along life’s thorny road,
    Faints the soul beneath its load,
    By its cares and sins opprest,
    Finds on earth no peace or re s t;
    When the wily temp ter’s near,
    Filling us with doubts and fear;
    Jesus—to Thy feet we flee, 
    Jesus—we will look to Thee,

    2. Thou, our Saviour, from the throne, 
    List’nest to Thy people’s moan;
    Thou, the living Head, dost share 
    Ev’ry pang the members bear
    Full of tenderness Thou art,
    Thou wilt heal the broken h eart;
    Full of power, Thine arm shall quell 
    All the rage and might of hell.

    3. Thou, O Jesus, Thou hast borne 
    Satan’s rage—the worldling’s scorn; 
    Thou hast known the bitter hour,
    Of the wily tempter’s power;
    Lo, Thy bloody sweat we see,
    In the dark Gethsemane!
    Hark! that piercing awful cry,
    From the Mount of Calvary.

    4. By that Love which brought Thee down 
    From Thy high eternal throne,
    Veiled the Lord of earth and skies,
    In an infant’s lowly guise;
    By that Love which healed the maim, 
    Cured the sick, restored the lame,
    Bade the darken’d eye to see,
    Jesus, we will look to Thee!

    5. By Thy tears o’er Lazarus shed,
    By Thy power to raise the dead,
    By Thy meekness under scorn,
    By Thy stripes and crown of th orn; 
    By that rich and precious blood,
    That hath made our peace with God; 
    Jesus—to Thy feet we flee,
    Jesus—we will cling to Thee.

    6. Mighty to redeem and save,
    Thou hast overcome the grave;
    Thou the bars of death hast riv’n, 
    Open’d wide the gates of heav’n; 
    Soon in glory Thou shalt come, 
    Taking Thy poor pilgrims home; 
    Jesus, then we all shall be,
    Ever—ever—Lord, with Thee.
 
 

## 306.  Behold yon bright and countless throng
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zd4xWbahTq35%2DiXzF0IGZELo5jIO_VxI/edit?mode=html)



    1. Behold yon bright and countless throng, 
    Around the throne above,
    And hearken to their ceaseless song 
    Of Jesu’s dying love:
    From the rising of the sun,
    Unto where his course is done,
    Out of ev’ry land they came,
    All who loved the Saviour’s name.

    2. Behold the robes so dazzling white,
    In which array’d they stand;
    Like victors from a glorious fight,
    Palms waving in their hand:
    Out of sorrow, toil, and shame,
    Gladly borne for Jesus’ name;
    In His blood their robes made white,
    In His strength they won the fight.

    3. Behold they strike their golden lyres,
    How sweet, how loud the song!
    All heaven’s vast angelic choirs,
    In united strain prolong.
    “Glory be to Him, Who gave 
    His dear Son our souls to save;
    Glory to the Lamb, Whose blood 
    Reconciled us all to God!”

    4. Soon we shall join that countless throng,
    Safe in the heav’nly fold,
    And sing that new, that happy song,
    And wear our crowns of gold.
    Let us glory in the cross,
    Count all else but worthless dross, 
    And amidst reproach and shame, 
    Praise our Jesu’s precious name.
 
 

## 307.  'O happy day! when first we felt'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlmpqTgOhmaUaUMngj7FIUThep8geuZ5/edit?mode=html)



    1. O h a p p y day! when first we felt 
    Our souls with true contrition m e lt;
    And all our sins of crimson guilt 
    Were cleansed by blood on Calv’ry spilt.

    2. O happy day! when Jesus’ love 
    Began our grateful hearts to move,
    And gazing on the wond’rous cross,
    We saw all else as worthless dross.

    3. O happy day! when, sin no more,
    We meet Him Whom our souls adore; 
    When sorrows, conflicts, fears, shall cease, 
    And all our trials end in peace.

    4. O happy day! when we shall see,
    And cast our longing eyes on Thee;
    On Thee our light, our life, our love,
    Our all below, our heaven above.308

    5. O happy day of cloudless light!
    Eternal day without a night!
    Lord, when shall we its dawning see, 
    And spend it all in praising Thee?

    6. Come, Saviour, come! O quickly come! 
    Take us Thy waiting people home;
    We long to stand around Thy throne,
    To love and serve Thee, Lord, alone.
 
 

## 308.  'Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zndoR6cPyeuPFV3THYn8MH8tafMPH9xz/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?
    O height, O depth of love!
    One with us on the cursed tree,
    We one with Thee above?

    2. Such was Thy grace, that for our sake
    Thou didst from heav’n come down, 
    Our mortal flesh and blood partake,
    In all our misery one.

    3. Our sins, our guilt, in love divine,
    Confess’d and borne by Thee;
    The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine, 
    To set Thy members free.

    4. Ascended now, in glory bright,
    Still one with us Thou a r t;
    Nor life, nor death, nor depth, nor height, 
    Thy saints and Thee can part.

    5. O teach us, Lord, to know and own
    This wondrous mystery,
    That Thou with us art truly one,
    And we are one with Thee.

    6. Soon, soon shall come that glorious day,
    When, seated on Thy throne,
    Thou shalt to wond’ring worlds display: 
    That Thou with us art one!
 
 

## 309.  'We''re not of the world which fadeth away.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlNSiX75A%2DnMy6uohme2tcvfMKkWGhmO/edit?mode=html)



    1. We’re not of the world which fadeth away. 
    We’re not of the night, but children of day; 
    The chains th at once bound us, by Jesus are
    riv’n,
    We’re strangers on earth, and our home is 
    in heav’n.

    2. Our path is most rugged, and dang’rous too, 
    A wide trackless waste our journey lies
    through;310
    But the Pillar of Cloud that shews us our way, 
    Is our sure light by night, and shades us by 
    day.

    3. Our Shepherd is still our Guardian and Guide, 
    Before us He goes to help and provide;
    We drink of the streams from the Rock that 
    was riv’n,
    Our bread is the Manna that came down from 
    heav’n.

    4. Mid mightiest foes—most feeble are we— 
    Yet trembling in ev’ry conflict they flee;
    The Lord is our Banner— the battle is His- 
    The weakest of saints more than conqueror is.

    5. Soon shall we enter our own promis’d land, 
    Before His bright throne in glory shall stand: 
    Our song then for ever and ever shall be,
    “All glory and blessing, Lord Jesus, to Thee!”
 
 

## 310.  'See, He comes, He won the day!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1codXdID8f0WfUR%2DsFgVDXip111FMrhYd/edit?mode=html)



    1. See, He comes, He won the day! 
    Go ye forth to meet H im;
    Bring the palm, and strew the way, 
    And with singing greet Him.
    Jesus is the victor’s name,
    Jesus, Lord of glory!
    Fly, ye heralds, spread His fame, 
    Tell the joyful story.

    2. Well His people now may sing,
    Sing with exultation;
    Since the victor is their King,
    And He brings salvation.
    Make the Saviour’s triumph known, 
    Let the nations hear i t;
    He alone deserves the crown,
    He alone shall wear it.
 
 

## 311.  Soon shall our Master come.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11jdngmXiFFuYQP467kXA2%2DKjzn_8bWEc/edit?mode=html)



    1. Soon shall our Master come,
    Our toil and sorrow cease;
    He’ll call His waiting servants home, 
    And all be joy and peace.

    2. Now may we do His will,
    In all His footsteps tread;
    And, in a world of evil, still 
    To grieve Him only dread.312

    3. May we His name confess
    ’Midst suffering, shame, and loss; 
    Stand forth His faithful witnesses,
    And glory in the Cross.

    4. Watchful may each be found,
    Our loins well girded b e;
    In works of faith and love abound,
    Till we our Master see.

    5. Then shall we soar above,
    Nor cease our sweet employ;
    And hear Him say, with tend’rest love, 
    “Enter Thy Master's joy.”
 
 

## 312.  'Great God, as Father Thee we claim'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_HA4OQ7esmOpMPQOOtbJKorGO4CBLrv/edit?mode=html)



    1. Great God, as Father Thee we claim, 
    And bless the Son’s most precious name,
    Thro' Whom this grace is giv’n;
    Who bore the curse to sinners due,
    Who form d our ruin’d souls anew,
    And made us heirs of heav’n.

    2.’Tis by the Holy Ghost alone,
    That Jesus Christ is made our own,
    The Gift of Grace divine.
    But since to us in Jesu’s face 
    There shines the Glory of Thy Grace,
    We know that we are Thine.

    3. Then while we here together join,
    Before the throne of Grace Divine,
    Bow down a Father’s ear;
    And while we listen to Thy word,
    Or praise Thy name with glad accord, 
    Amongst us, Lord, appear.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11gfwi201Z8IF_3Va9I55BsN9BYrkncwl/edit?mode=html)



    1. Who then shall God’s elect condemn?
    Since Jesus for their ransom died; 
    Rising, He intercedes for them,
    And they in Him are justified.

    2. Not tribulation, nakedness,
    The famine, peril, or the sword,
    Nor persecution nor distress,
    Shall separate from Christ the Lord.

    3. Nor life, nor death, nor depth, nor height,
    Nor powers below, nor powers above, * 
    Nor present things, nor things to come,- 
    Can change His purposes of love.314

    4. His sovereign mercy knows no bounds,
    His faithfulness shall still endure;
    And those who on His word rely,
    Shall find this truth for ever sure.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11b5IMhvDtu1uVqhjnynf9F1c2f9VZLZI/edit?mode=html)



    1. O d r a w me, Saviour, after Thee,
    So shall I run, and never tire:
    With gracious words still comfort me,
    Be Thou my hope, my sole desire;
    Free me from every w eight: nor fear,
    Nor sin can come, if Thou art near.

    2. W hat in Thy love possess I not?
    My star hy night, my sun by day,
    My spring of life, when parch’d with drought, 
    My wine to cheer, my bread to stay,
    My strength, my shield, my safe abode,
    My robe before the throne of G od!

    3. From all Eternity with love
    Unchangeable Thou hast me viewed;
    Ere knew this beating heart to move,
    Thy tender mercies me pursued:
    Ever with me may they abide,
    And close me in on every side.

    1. Awake, ye saints, awake and watch,
    The Bridegroom may be near;
    How awful, should His coming catch 
    His people slumb’ring here!

    2. They who are ready to attend
    The Lord when He appears,
    With Him to glory shall ascend;
    Eternal life is theirs.

    3. ith Him they shall sit down, and feast 
    On heav’n’s unbounded store;
    Enjoy an everlasting rest,
    And never hunger more.

    4. When once the chamber door shall close,
    ’Tis sure beyond a doubt,
    No further hope remains for those 
    Who then are found without.

    5. Awake, and be ye like to those
    Who wait their Lord’s return;
    Awake, nor yield to that repose,
    Whose end it is to mourn,

    1. Jesus comes by crowds attended,
    Heav’n the dazzling train supplies:
    Call the dead; the night is ended;
    Bid the sleeping dust arise:
    Let the ransom’d 
    Join the Saviour in the skies.

    2.’Tis the day so long expected;
    Shout, ye saints, and triumph now;
    See your Lord, by man rejected;
    Many crowns adorn His brow;
    ’Tis His triumph:
    Ev’ry knee to Him shall bow.

    1. Jesus, we hail Thee Israels King;
    To Thee our tribute, Lord, we bring;
    Nor do we fear to bow the knee;
    They worship God, who worship Thee.

    2. Hail! Israel’s King, enthron’d in light, 
    Whose glory never shone more bright 
    Than when, by faithless friends betray’d, 
    Thy foes insulting homage paid.

    3. Then did admiring angels see 
    Divine forbearance, Lord, in Thee;
    With emphasis pronounce Thee good; 
    And heav’n and earth contrasted stood.

    4. An object of contempt beneath,
    And judg’d by men to suffer death;
    By angels own’d, admir’d, ador’d,
    The great, the everlasting Lord!

    5. Reign, mighty Lord, for ever reign!
    Thy cause throughout the world maintain 
    Let Israel’s God His triumphs spread, 
    And crowns of glory wreath His head!
 
 

## 318.  Sing aloud to God our strength.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Wb1y8%2DnZGDJhu4vQPBN%2DeLhW5LI2dZu/edit?mode=html)



    1. Sing aloud to God, our strength;
    He has brought us hitherto;
    He will bring us home at length;
    This the Lord our God will do: 
    Doubt not, for His word is stable; 
    Fear not, for His arm is able.

    2. Sing aloud to God, our strength • 
    Sing with wonder of His love;
    Who can tell its breadth and length?
    Who below, or who above?
    Who its depth and height can measure? 
    ’Tis a rich unbounded treasure!

    3. Sing aloud to God, our strength;
    He is with us where we go;
    Fear we not the journey’s length,
    Fear we not the mighty foe:
    All our foes shall be defeated,
    And our journey be completed.
 
 

## 319.  In our Lord we have redemption
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PdaNoDzdSkrL5cTzS1OLTLKvhUmbrei/edit?mode=html)



    1. In our Lord we have redemption,
    Full remission in His blood;
    From the curse entire exemption,
    From the curse pronounc’d by God: 
    W hat a Saviour Jesus is!
    O what love, what love is His!

    2. Praise be His, all praise transcending, .
    Praise on earth, and praise in heav’n; 
    Praise through ages never-ending,
    To the Lamb of God be giv’n:
    He alone the Saviour is,
    Everlasting praise be His.
 
 

## 320.  Ours is a pardon bought with blood
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oUfqsB8XdEqBirQuTYUMjGA3%2D1tn74s/edit?mode=html)



    1. Ours is a pardon bought with blood,
    Amazing tru th! the blood of One 
    Who, without usurpation, could 
    Lay claim to heav'n’s eternal throne.

    2. No victim of inferior worth
    Could ward the stroke that justice aim’d; 
    For none but He, in heav’n or earth,
    Could offer that which justice claim’d.

    3. But He, the Lord of glory, came;
    On yonder cross He bow’d His head;
    He suffer’d pain, He suffer’d shame,
    And lay a pris’ner with the dead.

    4. But lo 1 He rises from the grave,
    And bears the greatest, sweetest name; 
    The Lord, almighty now to save,
    From sin, from death, from endless shame.
 
 

## 321.  Saviour through the desert lead us.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DQSWF4nVuQPUpPEk_9goSbI%2DC1amY3uM/edit?mode=html)



    1. Saviour, through the desert lead us, 
    Without Thee we cannot go;
    Thou from cruel chains hast freed us, 
    Thou hast laid the tyrant low:
    Let Thy presence 
    Cheer us all our journey through.

    2. With a price Thy love has bought us, 
    (Saviour, what a love is Thine!) 
    Hitherto Thy pow’r has brought us, 
    (Pow’r and love in Thee combine): 
    Lord of glory,
    Ever on Thy household shine.

    3. Through a desert waste and cheerless, 
    Though our destin’d journey lie, 
    Render’d by Thy presence fearless,
    We may ev’ry foe defy:
    Nought shall move us,
    While we see the Saviour nigh.

    4. When we halt, (no track discov’ring), 
    Fearful lest we go astray,
    O’er our path Thy pillar hov’ring,
    Fire by night, and cloud by day, 
    Shall direct u s;
    Thus we shall not miss our way.

    5. When we hunger, Thou wilt feed us, 
    Manna shall our camp surround;
    Faint and thirsty, Thou wilt heed us, 
    Streams shall from the Rock abound: 
    Happy people!
    What a Saviour have we found!

    6. When our foes in arms assemble,
    Ready to obstruct our way,
    Suddenly their hearts shall tremble,
    Thou wilt strike them with dismay i 
    And Thy people,
    Led by Thee, shall win the day.

    7. Then lead on, Almighty Victor,
    Scatter ev’ry hostile band;
    Be our guide and our protector,
    Till on Canaan’s shores we land: 
    Where in glory
    Soon we hope with Thee to stand.
 
 

## 322.  'Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DNtBWx1SOsRKZ2FROh8w3dyekYzqmVWF/edit?mode=html)



    1. Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee,
    Stranger hands no more impede;
    Pass thou on, His hand protects thee, 
    Strength th at has the captive freed.

    2. Is the wilderness before thee,
    Desert lands where drought abides?Heavenly springs shall there restore thee, 
    Fresh from God’s exhaustless tides.

    3. Light divine surrounds thy going,
    God Himself shall mark thy way, 
    Secret blessings, richly flowing,
    Lead to everlasting day.

    4. God, thine everlasting portion,
    Feeds thee with the mighty’s meat, 
    Price of Egypt’s hard extortion,
    Egypt’s food no more to eat.

    5. Art thou wean’d from Egypt’s pleasures?
    God in secret thee shall keep,
    There unfold His hidden treasures,
    There His love’s exhaustless deep.

    6. In the desert God will teach thee
    ' What the God that thou hast found, 
    Patient, gracious, powerful, holy,
    All His grace shall there abound.

    7. On to Canaan’s rest still wending,
    E’en thy wants and woes shall bring 
    Suited grace from high descending,
    Thou shalt taste of mercy’s spring.

    8. Though thy way be long and dreary,
    Eagle strength He’ll still renew:
    Garments fresh, and foot unweary 
    Tell how God hath brought thee through.

    9. When to Canaan’s long-loved dwelling
    Love divine thy foot shall bring,
    There with shouts of triumph swelling 
    Zion’s songs in rest to sing:


    1.0 Then no stranger God shall meet thee,
    Stranger thou in courts above,
    He who to His rest shall greet thee,
    Greets thee with a well-known love.
 
 

## 323.  'Would we view God''s brightest glory'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DaD7aD%2DuofJEHOa_NDnYHPBvlYRTNe8n/edit?mode=html)



    1. Would we view God’s brightest glory,
    We must look in Jesu’s face;
    Sing, and tell the pleasing story,
    O ye sinners sav’d by grace;
    And with pleasure,
    Bid the guilty Him embrace.

    2. In His highest work, redemption,
    See His glory fully blaze:
    Nor can angels ever mention 
    Aught that more of God displays;
    Grace and justice 
    Here unite to endless days.

    3. In the person of the Saviour,—
    God’s full majesty is seen;
    Love and justice shine for ever;
    And, without a veil between,
    Man may meet Him,
    And rejoice in His great name.

    4. O how true and blest the pleasure,
    God to view in Christ the Lord; 
    There He smiles, and smiles for ever; 
    Let the church this tru th record;
    Praise and bless Him!
    And His wonders spread abroad.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DSG58Ey3IzGSj8Yvjw9CiZQwtBcUDeSJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Since Thou, my Lord, art nigh, 
    Foes I may well defy,
    Strong is Thine arm;
    Since grace and truth are Thine, 
    Wisdom and love divine—
    Triumph and peace are mine: 
    Nothing shall harm.

    2. Nothing shall greatly move 
    Those who Thy kindness prove,
    Blessed alone;
    Strong their Redeemer is, 
    Greatness and grace are His, 
    This, and far more than this, 
    Lord, is Thine own.

    3. Then let Thy favour be 
    Dearer than life to me,
    Be Thy name dear;
    When foes against me fight,
    Then raise Thine arm of might, 
    Then save Thy worm from flight, 
    Save him from fear.
 
 

## 325.  'Thy name we bless, Lord Jesus.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DH%2D3mSLmEVVpPtXHrqN_2AJxGgePXeix/edit?mode=html)



    i

    1. Thy name we bless, Lord Jesus, 
    That name all names excelling,
    How great Thy love 
    All praise above,
    Should ev’ry tongue be telling.
    The Father’s loving-kindness,
    In giving Thee was shewn u s;
    Now by Thy blood 
    Redeem’d to God,
    As children He doth own us.325

    2. From that eternal glory
    Thou hadst with God the Father, 
    He sent His Son 
    That He in one,
    His children all might gather;
    Our sins were all laid on Thee, 
    God’s wrath Thou hast endured; 
    It was for us 
    Thou suffredst thus,
    And hast our peace secured.

    3. Thou from the dead wast raised— 
    And from all condemnation
    Thy Church is free,
    As ris’n in Thee,
    Head of the new creation!
    On high Thou hast ascended,
    To God’s right hand in heaven, 
    The Lamb once slain,
    Alive again,—
    To Thee all power is given.

    4. Thou hast bestow’d the earnest 
    Of th at we shall inherit;
    Till Thou shalt come 
    To take us home,
    We’re seal’d by God the Spirit.
    We wait for Thine appearing,
    When we shall know more fully,
    The Priest and King 
    Whose praise we sing,
    Thou Lamb of God most holy!
 
 

## 326.  'Thou, Lamb of God! didst shed Thy blood.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DDRCqsOw87FW_lQD0A98Ed2cbQm81OdG/edit?mode=html)



    Thou, Lamb of God! didst shed Thy blood 
    Thou didst our load of misery bear;
    And hast exalted us to share 
    The rank of Kings and Priests to God.
    To Thee we render evermore 
    The honour, glory, praise th at’s due; 
    Might, power, and obedience, too,
    And in our hearts we Thee adore.
    Amen! Am en!
    O Lord, Amen!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DQWIbVpHnLMQBO1w5UofNoBEx%2DO4jh4U/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Je s us! everlasting God!
    Who didst for sinners shed Thy blood 
    Upon the shameful tre e;
    And finish there redemption’s toil,
    And wTin for us the happy spoil,
    All praise we give to Thee.328

    2. Fain would we think upon Thy pain, 
    Would find therein our life and gain,
    And firmly fix the heart 
    Upon Thy grief and dying love,
    Nor evermore from Thee remove,
    Though from all else we part.

    3. The more through grace ourselves we know, 
    The more rejoic’d we are to bow
    And glory in Thy cross;
    To trust in Thine atoning blood,
    And look to Thee for ev’ry good,
    And count all else but loss.
 
 

## 328.  Jesus for us a body took
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DQ94zh7kPuMMNEK9Xg9ZWR2JFF5v5qxG/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus for us a body took,
    Our guilt assum’d, our bondage broke, 
    Discharging all our dreadful debt; 
    Then let us ne’er this love forget?

    2. Let us renounce our ways with grief, 
    And cleave to this most sure relief; 
    Nor Him forget Who left the throne, 
    And for our life gave up His own.

    3. Ah no! till time itself depart,
    His name shall cheer and warm each h ea rt; 
    And, shouting this, from earth we’ll rise 
    To join the chorus of the skies.

    4. Ah no! when all things else expire,
    And perish in the general fire,
    His name all others shall survive,
    And through eternity shall live.
 
 

## 329.  'O Saviour! can it ever be'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DIar_W1N6PKgP5sI3dhLY4tkwuCO0lgW/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Saviour! can it ever be
    That we should be asham’d of Thee? 
    And not with joy Thy name confess 
    Before Thy proudest enemies?

    2. Asham’d of Jesus—Lamb of God,
    Who freed us by His precious blood; 
    Of Him, Who to retrieve our loss 
    Despis’d the shame, endur’d the cross.

    3. Asham’d of Jesus—of that friend 
    Whose love to us can know no en d!330
    It must not be—this be our shame 
    That we no more confess His name.

    4. The world’s anointed King and Lord,
    By all the hosts of heav’n ador’d!
    Yes! we will make our boast of Thee, 
    Now, and to all eternity.

    5. And when we stand before Thy throne, 
    Thou wilt confess us as Thine own,— 
    And, for the world’s rejecting frown, 
    Give to each saint a royal crown.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2DdwMg872E62lqanlEyuwTLJZ4YWCHflB/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Thou Who hast redeem’d of old, 
    And made me of Thy grace take hold,
    And be at peace with Thee,
    Help me these blessings now to own, 
    And tell aloud what Thou hast done, 
    O Holy Lamb, for me.

    2. O Thou incarnate Deity,
    Who hast Thy love vouchsaf’d to me, 
    Thy love’s the plea I make,
    Give me this pow’r,’tis all I claim,
    With heart and life to serve Thy name, 
    Give, for Thy mercy’s sake.

    3. Love, only love, Thy heart inclin’d,
    And brought Thee, Saviour of mankind,
    Down from the throne above;
    Love made Thee here a man of grief, 
    Distress’d Thee sore for our relief,
    O mystery of love!

    4. Then since Thou, Lord, didst die for me, 
    Cause me, my Saviour, to love Thee,
    And gladly to resign 
    Whate’er I have, whate’er I am,
    My life be all with Thine the same,
    And all Thy shame be mine.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrBQ7rIyQQ_Ed5w7Gmq7T%2Dp0Fo9Yg8kN/edit?mode=html)



    1. His mournful days of flesh are o’er, 
    Accomplish’d is His sacrifice,
    He suffer’d once, but dies no more, 
    Nor adds to that stupendous price, 
    Which purchas’d fbr the faithful race 
    Pardon, and peace, and holiness.

    2. All who are call’d by grace as His, 
    Out of this evil world He takes, 
    And renders meet for endless bliss, 
    Partakers of His nature makes; 
    And crowns with all the joy above, 
    Their patient faith, and humble love.
 
 

## 332.  We go to meet the Saviour.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xPTFUZKz14HZ4qmIEN8a%2DuUImkf%2Dtw4I/edit?mode=html)



    1. We go to meet the Saviour,
    His glorious face to see;
    What manner of behaviour 
    Doth with this hope agree?
    May God’s illumination,
    Guide heart and hand aright; 
    That so our preparation 
    Be pleasing in His sight.

    2. W e’d gladly wile the hours,
    Till night shall pass away,
    And chant with all our powers 
    The blessings of that day;
    To Thee, the King of glory,
    W e’d raise the happy song, 
    And make Thy love’s bright story 
    The theme of ev’ry tongue.

    3. This caus’d Thine incarnation,
    This brought Thee from on high, 
    Thy thirst for our salvation,
    This made Thee come to d ie;
    O love beyond all measure, 
    Wherewith Thou didst embrace 
    The victims of the pressure 
    Of sin and its disgrace!

    4. Not sinful man’s endeavour,
    Nor any mortal’s care,
    Could draw Thy sov’reign favour 
    To sinners in despair;
    Uncall’d Thou cam’st with gladness, 
    Us from the fall to raise,
    And change our grief and sadness, 
    To songs of joy and praise.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xMmdA0AqCh_hwWVMU8v0YOs3VQHJMOfp/edit?mode=html)



    1. To us, our God His love commends,
    When by our sins undone;
    That He might spare His enemies, 
    He would not spare His Son,—

    2. His only Son, on whom He plac’d
    His whole delight and love,334
    Before He form’d the earth below,
    Or spread the heav’ns above.

    3. Our sorrows and our sins to bear,
    Our heavy cross sustain;
    Upon the tree He came to die,
    That we might life obtain.

    4. This life is hid in God with Him,
    Who fell a sacrifice,
    And dying, conquer’d death for us, 
    That we, like Him, might rise.

    5. Quickly He triumph’d o’er the grave,
    And went to heav’n again;
    There intercedes, and thence will come 
    With all His saints to reign.

    6. His wTord assures He’ll quickly come
    For this His brethren pray;
    The whole creation for it groans, 
    Come, Lord, without delay.

    1. Thou God of grace, our Father 
    We now rejoice before Thee;
    Thy children we,
    And lov’d by Thee,
    ’Tis meet we should adore Thee!
    As Thine Thou didst foreknow us, 
    For such was Thine election,
    And Thou hast shewn 
    To us “Thine own”
    Thy fulness of affection.

    2. Thou didst in Jesus choose us 
    Before the world’s foundation;
    Ere Adam’s fall 
    Involv’d us all 
    In guilt and condemnation.
    Thy purpose and election,
    In spite of all our failing,
    Have firmly stood,
    And by the blood 
    Of Christ are made availing.

    3. The grace of Thy salvation
    The Holy Ghost hath taught u s; 
    By Him we’re seal’d,
    For He reveal’d
    How Jesu’s blood hath bought us. 
    Soon, all the church in glory.
    In its predestin’d station,
    Shall bless Thy name,
    With Christ “The Lamb,” 
    Thou God of our salvation!335

    1. Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice and praise 
    The blessing of redeeming grace;
    Jesus, your everlasting tow’r,
    Mocks at the angry tempest’s roar.

    2. His love’s a refuge ever nigh,
    His watchfulness, a mountain high;
    His name’s a rock, which winds above 
    And waves below can never move.

    3. His faithfulness for ever sure,
    For endless ages will endure;
    His perfect work will ever prove 
    The depth of His unchanging love.

    4. While all things change, He changes not, 
    He ne’er forgets, though oft forgot;
    His love’s unchangeably the same,
    And as enduring as His name.

    5. Rejoice, ye saints, rejoice and praise 
    The blessings of this wondrous grace; 
    Jesus, your everlasting tow’r,
    Can bear unmov’d the tempest’s roar.

    1. Poor, weak, and worthless, though I am,
    I have a rich Almighty friend,
    Jesus, the Saviour, is His name,
    He freely loves, and without end.

    2. He ransom’d me from hell with blood,
    And by His pow’r my foes controll’d; 
    He found me wand’ring far from God,
    And brought me to His chosen fold.

    3.He cheers my heart—my want supplies, 
    And says that I shall shortly be 
    Enthron’d with Him above the skies:
    O what a friend is Christ to m e!

    1. O gra c ious Fath er! God of love!
    We own Thy pow’r to save,—
    That pow’r by w'hich our Shepherd rose 
    Victorious o’er the grave.

    2. Him from the dead Thou brought’st again,
    When, by His sacred blood 
    Confirm’d and seal’d for evermore,
    Th’ eternal cov’nant stood.338

    3. O let Thy Spirit seal our souls,

    That from Thy paths we ne’er may stray, 
    But keep Thy precepts s till!

    4. That to perfection’s sacred height

    1. O that we never might forget
    What Christ has suffer’d for our sake,
    To save our souls, and make us meet 
    Of all His glory to partake;
    But keeping this in mind, press on 
    To glory and the victor’s throne.

    2. But, gracious Lord, when we reflect
    How oft we’ve tu rn’d the eye from Thee, 
    And treating Thee with sad neglect,
    Have listen’d to the enemy,
    And yet to find Thee still the same—
    ’Tis this that humbles us with shame.

    3. Astonish’d at Thy feet we fall,
    Thy love exceeds our highest thought,
    Henceforth be Thou our all in all,
    Thou Who our souls with blood hast bought; 
    May we henceforth more faithful prove,
    And ne’er forget Thy ceaseless love.

    1. From various cares our hearts retire,
    Though deep and boundless their desire,
    We’re now to please but O ne;
    He, before Whom the elders bow,
    With Him is all our bus’ness now,
    And those that are His own.

    2. With these our happy lot is cast,
    Through the world’s deserts rude and waste,
    Or through its gardens fair;
    Whether the storms of trouble sweep,
    Or all in dead supineness sleep,
    T’ advance be all our care.

    3. O Lord, our way, our truth, our life!
    Let sin and sorrow, doubt and strife,
    Drop off like autumn leaves;
    And may we, privileg’d by Thee,
    Simple and undistracted be,
    The church which to Thee cleaves.

    4. Let us the weary mind recline 
    On that eternal love of Thine,
    And human thoughts forget;
    Child-like attend what Thou wilt say,
    Go forth and serve Thee while’tis day,
    Yet leave not our retreat.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x8VOElTZm_7qLPg1WN_b9dgCJcBGwuxu/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, Who vanquish’d all our foes,
    Who came to save, Who reigns to bless, 
    From Thee our ev’ry comfort flows,
    Life, liberty, and joy, and peace.
    Resound, ye saints, the joyful strain,
    Let Him, the King of glory, reign.

    2. O Thou art worthy, gracious Lord,
    Of universal, endless praise,
    With ev’ry pow’r to be ador’d 
    That men or angels e’er can raise.
    And heav’n and earth shall blend their strains, 
    Jesus, the King of glory, reigns.

    3. But earth and heav’n can ne’er proclaim
    The boundless glories of their King;
    Yet do our hearts adore His name,
    The name whence all our blessings spring.
    Resound, resound the joyful strain,
    Let Him, the King of glory, reign

    4. How mean the tribute that we pay!
    How cold the heart, how faint the tongue! 
    But O a bright eternal day 
    Will bring a more exalted song, 
    Resounding in immortal strains,
    Jesus, the King of glory, reigns!

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEH6VKBjhBDyjHtKfyhMb9Ec%2DSYzpAZQ/edit?mode=html)



    1. Salvation’s Captain, and the guide
    Of all that seek the rest above,
    Beneath Thy shadow we abide,
    The cloud of Thy protecting love;
    Our strength Thy grace, our rule Thy word, 
    Our end, the glory of our Lord.

    2. By Thine unerring Spirit led,
    We shall not in the desert stray,
    Or light for our direction need,
    Or lose, though dark and drear, our way, 
    But kept from danger, and from fear,
    Since Thine Almighty love is near.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zT3DGlbty%2DMkTI6XhFQdcMQmnOSBe_jl/edit?mode=html)



    1. Strangers and pilgrims here below,
    This earth we own not as our place,, 
    But hasten through its toil and woe, 
    Impatient to behold Thy face;
    On to our heav’nly country move,
    Our everlasting home above.

    2. We’ve no continuing city here,
    But seek a city out of sight,
    Thither our upward course we steer,.
    As dwellers in its courts of lig ht; 
    Jerusalem, the saints’ abode,
    Whose builder is the living God.

    3. Patient, th’ appointed race we run,
    This weary world we cast behind, 
    From strength to strength we travel on, 
    Our holy dwelling-place to find;
    Our labour this, our only aim,
    To reach the new Jerusalem.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVNOs7tAykNGgbUtViGyCgQ%2Dr4e1hJ0a/edit?mode=html)



    X Cross, reproach, and tribulation,
    Of the church are certain guests,
    When she has this consolation,
    That on Christ alone she rests.

    2. The reproach of Christ is glorious—
    All who here His burden bear,
    In the end will prove victorious,
    And eternal glories share.

    3. Christ, the ever blessed Saviour,
    Bore for us reproach and shame; 
    Now as conqu’ror lives for ever,
    And we conquer in His name.

    4. Bear we, then, reproach for Jesus,
    Living still a life of faith;
    Let us sing glad songs of praises, 
    Though it be’mid shame and death,

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zQDu3HUGPF8%2D%2DigpW4Ay08j0wW59TYa8/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Israel, to thy tents repair,
    Why so secure on hostile ground? 
    The King commands thee to beware, 
    For many foes thy camp surround.

    2. The trumpet sounds a martial strain,
    Then Israel gird thee for the fight; 
    Arise, the combat to maintain,
    And put thine enemies to flight.345

    3. Thou should’st not sleep as others do,
    Awake, be vigilant, be brave;
    The coward and the sluggard too,
    Must wear the fetters of the slave.

    4. A nobler lot is cast for thee,
    Fair Canaan’s spread before thine eyes: 
    With such a hope, shall Israel flee?
    Or yield through weariness the prize?

    5. No, though a careless world repose,
    And slumber on through life’s short day, 
    God’s Israel to the conflict goes,
    And bears the glorious prize away.
 
 

## 345.  We tread the path our Master trod.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zS4GRBVZOcM3yjFN4LBrwNMFleuBHAk3/edit?mode=html)



    1. We tread the path our Master trod,
    What can we wish for more?
    And ev’ry thorn that wounds our feet 
    His temples pierc’d before.

    2. Our Shepherd’s pow’r is always near,
    His arm outstretch’d in love!
    And while our bodies wander here, 
    Our hearts are fix’d above.

    3. Afflictions purge our dross away, 
    Refining as we ru n;
    And, while we die to earth and sense, 
    Our heav’n is here begun.
 
 

## 346.  Above the clouds a city stands
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zGMkvQPosRivkEspEVjP2TxGQIcDCOu8/edit?mode=html)



    1. Above the clouds a city stands,
    Of living stones not made with hands, 
    Where God the Saviour’ll reign:
    Tis built for sinners bought with blood, 
    Redeem’d and sanctified to God,
    And cleans’d from every stain.

    2. The cities of this world must fall, 
    However solid, they must all
    The common ruin share;
    But yonder city still appears 
    Unchangeable through endless years, 
    For God Himself is there,

    3. Happy the saints who shall abide 
    Within those walls, and there reside
    For ever with the K ing;
    We hope that we shall soon be there, 
    Its joys and blessedness to share,
    The Saviour’s praise to sing.347—348

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSV1BhqkmbOjAA0%2DoBt3c9kaf7RuVXvs/edit?mode=html)



    1. A h! who upon earth can conceive
    The bliss that in heaven Saints share? 
    Or who this dark world would not leave, 
    And earnestly long to be there?
    There Christ is the light and the sun,
    His glories unhinder’dly shine;
    His presence their spirits have won.
    And rest in the glory divine.

    2.’Tis good, at His word, to be here,
    Yet better it is to be gone,
    And there in His presence appear,
    And rest as He rests on the throne; 
    Yet a h! it will gladden our eyes,
    When Him we behold on the cloud, 
    And echo the joys of the skies,
    And shout to the trum pet of God.
 
 

## 348.  What will it be to dwell above.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zY6mbHRJnw1ohTBQybPx7ScXTfybA3oj/edit?mode=html)



    1. W hat will it be to dwell above,
    And with the Lord of glory reign, 
    Since the sweet earnest of His love,
    So brightens all th is dreary plain:
    No heart can think, no tongue explain, 
    What jo y’t will be with Christ to reign.

    2. When sin no more obstructs our sight,
    And flesh and sense deceive no more, 
    When we shall see the Prince of light, 
    And all His works of grace explore: 
    What heights and depths of love divine, 
    Will there through endless ages shine!

    3. And God has fix’d the happy day,
    When the last tear shall dim our eyes, 
    When He will wipe these tears away, 
    And fill our hearts with glad surprise; 
    To hear His voice, and see His face,
    And feel His infinite embrace.

    4. This is the joy we seek to know.
    For this with patience we would wait, 
    Till call’d from earth and all below,
    We mount to our celestial seat;
    To wave our palms, and wear the crown, 
    And at His feet to cast them down.
 
 

## 349.  Soon on this wretched scene of night.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zGZ99ME2ytJEIsEpV1lDm9M_D_qYC8il/edit?mode=html)



    1. Soon on this wretched scene of night 
    Unbounded bliss shall rise,
    And realms of infinite delight 
    Shall gladden mortal eyes.

    2. There pain and sickness ne’er shall come,
    There man shall ne’er complain;
    But all who reach that peaceful home, 
    With Jesus there shall reign.

    3. No cloud that region e’er shall know
    For ever bright and fair;
    For sin, the source of mortal woe,
    Can never enter there.

    4. O may the heav’nly vision fire
    Our hearts with ardent love,
    Till wings of faith and strong desire 
    Bear ev’ry thought above.
 
 

## 350.  'Hail, blessed scene of endless joy!'

    1. Hail, blessed scene of endless jo y!
    Where Jesus shall for ever reign,
    Where nothing hurtful shall annoy,
    But gladness fill the happy plain:
    Free from all sin, and free from fear,
    None shall e’er sigh or shed a tear.

    2. Ten thousand thousands then shall raise
    Their joyful notes, and sing this strain;
    Awake the song of grateful praise,
    Unto the Lamb Who once was slain. 
    Hosannas, loud hosannas sing,
    Hosannas to th’ eternal King.

    3. Forever there with Jesus blest,
    They fear no death, and feel no pain, 
    But there shall be in endless rest,
    Where dangers ne’er shall threat again; 
    For Jesus reigns, and they shall share 
    With Him His fullest glory there.
 
 

## 351.  The countless multitude on high.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10EvKFT3CIICDGC1uwNM31rbiQ1WYMhn6/edit?mode=html)



    1. The countless multitude on high,
    That tune their songs to Jesu’s name, 
    All merit of their own deny,
    And Jesu’s worth alone proclaim.

    2. Firm on the ground of sov’reign grace,
    They stand before Jehovah’s throne; 
    The only song in which blest place 
    Is—“Thou art worthy 1 Thou alone!”

    3. With spotless robes of purest white,
    And branches of triumphal palm,351
    They shout, with transports of delight, 
    Heaven’s ceaseless universal psalm:—

    4. “Salvation’s glory all be paid
    To Him Who sits upon the throne;
    And to the Lamb, Whose blood was shed, 
    Thou! Thou art w orthy! Thou alone 1”

    5. " For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood
    These robes were wash’d so spotless pure 
    Thou mad’st us kings and priests to God— 
    For ever let Thy praise endure.”

    6. While thus the ransom’d myriads shout,
    “Amen,” the holy angels cry;
    “Amen, Amen,” resounds throughout 
    The boundless regions of the sky.

    7. Let us with joy adopt the strain
    We hope to sing for ever there;
    “Worthy’s the Lamb for sinners slain, 
    Worthy alone the crown to wear!”

    8. W ithout one thought th at’s good to plead,
    O what could shield us from despair 
    But this, though we are vile indeed,
    The Lord our Righteousness is there.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1%2Dnx5_lufgtVtg32vM9UYaSuNUVi136ms/edit?mode=html)



    1. To heaven’s eternal King
    The praise of saints be giv’n;
    His name, His glorious name we sing, 
    The rightful Heir of heav’n.

    2. He once was found with men,
    A man of sorrows H e;
    He bore His people’s sentence then,
    He bore it on the tree.

    3. He suffer’d in their stead,
    He sav’d His people th u s;
    The curse that fell upon His head, 
    Was due, by right, to us.

    4.’Twas love that brought Him down,
    The purest, strongest love;
    He bore the cross, He won the crown, 
    And now He reigns above.

    5. The praise of saints be given
    To Him Who worthy is;
    He died on earth—He lives in heav’n, 
    Eternal praise be His.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/104UbH7iV_jvzWRSCQ0c5TxhLiYoNqlXR/edit?mode=html)



    1. Though now we bear the chilly blast,
    Though cradled now in woe,
    The church shall ev’ry storm outlast, 
    Outlive each cruel foe.

    2. Then shall we sing of battles won,
    Of garments roll’d in blood,
    Of myriads slain by David’s Son,
    The conq’ring Lamb of God;

    3. Of blood that loos’d the captive’s chain,
    Redeem’d his life, and seal’d 
    The record of a deathless name 
    That lives in heav’n reveal’d.
 
 

## 354.  'See mercy, mercy from on high.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10WSQrjnRHpG0buhBa0tczFUkGbrdGlVO/edit?mode=html)



    1. See mercy, mercy from on high,
    Descend to rebels doom’d to die;
    ’Tis mercy free, which knows no bound; 
    How sweet, how blessed is the sound'

    2. Soon as the reign of sin began,
    The light of mercy dawn’d on man, 
    When God announc’d the early news,
    “The woman’s seed Thy head shall bruise.

    3. Brightly it beam’d on men forlorn, 
    When Christ, the holy child was born; 
    And brighter still in splendour shone, 
    When Jesus, dying, cried, “’Tis done 1”

    4. The work complete when He arose, 
    Bursting the snares of all His foes, 
    When captive led captivity,
    And took for us His seat on high.

    5. Till we around Him then shall throng, 
    This mercy shall be still our song;
    And ev’ry scheme shall God confound 
    Of all who strive its course to bound!

    1. Awake our souls! awake our tongues;
    The subject is divine:
    The Saviour’s love demands our songs; 
    Let all His people join.

    2. This Saviour is the Mighty God,
    Who rests in heav’n above;
    Reveal’d in flesh, He shed His blood, 
    And thus declar’d God’s love.356

    3. Jesus, Thy love exceeds our thought;
    But this at least we see,
    The soul that knows Thy pow’r is taught 
    To value nought but Thee.

    4. And though Thy love be faintly seen,
    W h a t’s seen demands our praise; 
    Without it, Lord, we still had been 
    Engag’d in folly’s ways.

    1. Sov’reign grace o’er sin abounding!
    Ransom’d souls the tidings swell, 
    ’Tis a deep that knows no sounding; 
    Who its breadth or length can tell?

    2. Sav’d by Christ, we’re free for ever,
    This the Spirit’s voice declares! 
    Death, nor hell, nor sin shall sever, 
    Jesus from the chosen heirs.

    3. Saints above, in His communion,
    Rest from conflict with their Head; 
    While we sing the blessed union, 
    Though in thorny paths we tread.

    1. To the Redeemer’s glorious name
    Awake the sacred song!
    O may His love (immortal flame!)
    Tune every heart and tongue.

    2. His love what human thought can reach?
    What tongue on earth display? 
    Imagination’s utmost stretch 
    In wonder dies away.

    3. Let wonder still with love unite,
    And gratitude with joy;
    Jesus be our supreme delight,
    His praise our blest employ.

    4. Jesus, Who left the throne on high,
    Left the bright realms of bliss,
    And came to earth to bleed and die:
    Was ever love like this?

    5. Dear Lord, we gladly, humbly pay
    Our grateful thanks to Thee,
    For, taught of God, we each can say,
    “The Saviour died for me.”

    1. Thy mercy, O God! is the theme of my song,

    1. Lord Jesus! we worship and bow at Thy feet,

    And swell the full chorus that gladdens the skies.

    1. Jesus! O name divinely sweet!
    How charming is the sound!
    What joyful news, what heavenly pow’r 
    In Thy dear name is found.

    2. Our souls, as guilty and condemn’d,
    In hopeless fetters lay 
    Our souls with numerous sins deprav’d,
    To death and hell a prey.

    3. Jesus, to purge away this guilt,
    A willing victim fell,
    And on His cross triumphant broke 
    The bands of death and hell.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xkbjBwpyKe7niiVSagzfnAv9gSkHFCxO/edit?mode=html)



    1. O Love divine, Thou vast abyss!
    My sins are swallow’d up in Thee; 
    Cover’d is my unrighteousness;
    From condemnation I am free.
    While Jesu’s blood through earth and skies, 
    “Mercy! free, boundless mercy 1 ” cries.

    2. Fix’d on this ground must I remain,
    Though my heart fail and flesh decay; 
    This anchor shall my soul sustain,
    When earth’s foundations melt away: 
    Mercy’s full pow’r I then shall prove,
    Lov’d with an everlasting love.

    1. Blessed are the sons of God!
    They are bought with Jesu’s blood;
    They are ransom’d from the grave;
    Life eternal they shall have.

    2. God did love them in His Son 
    Long before the world begun;
    They the seal of this receiv’d 
    When on Jesus they believ’d.

    3. They are lights upon the earth,
    Children of an heav’nly b irth;
    Born of God, they hate all sin,
    God’s pure seed remains within.

    4. They have fellowship with God 
    Through the Mediator’s blood:
    One with God, with Jesus one,
    Glory is in them begun.

    5. They alone are truly bless’d,
    Heirs of God, joint heirs with C hrist; 
    Blessed this fraternity,
    Here and in eternity!

    1. B r e th r e n , while we sojourn h e re,
    Fight we must, but should not fea r;
    Foes we have, but we’ve a Friend,
    One that loves us to the end.
    Forward, then, with courage go,
    Long we shall not dwell below;
    Soon the joyful news will come,
    “Child, your Father calls—Come home.”

    2. In the way a thousand snares 
    Lie, to take us unawares;
    Satan, with malicious art 
    Watches each unguarded part;
    But, from Satan’s malice free,
    Saints shall soon victorious be;
    Soon the joyful news will come,
    "Child, your Father calls— Come home.”

    3. But, of all the foes we meet,
    None so oft mislead our feet,
    None betray us into sin
    Like the foes that dwell within:
    Yet let nothing spoil your peace,
    Christ will also conquer th ese;
    And the joyful news will come,
    “Child, thy Father calls—Come home.”

    1. Behold the temple of the L ord!
    God’s building, where, by saints ador’d,
    His presence He reveals:
    Jehovah-Jesus, God of peace,
    Rears it to be His resting place,
    And there His glory dwells.365

    2. A temple this not made with hands,
    The workmanship of grace it stands,
    And ever shall endure:
    ’Tis founded on the “Living Stone,”
    And mid all changes shall be known, 
    Immutably secure.

    3. Time, that all other work destroys,
    Combin’d with power that hell employs,
    With safety it defies:
    Erected for God’s own name’s sake,
    Though earth with deep convulsions shake, 
    Majestic it shall rise.

    4. Age after age the work goes on;
    Soon shall we hear the voice, “’Tis done,” 
    And hail its crowning stone;
    With all the armies of the sky,
    " Grace! Grace unto i t!” we shall cry 
    And Jesu’s praise make known.

    1. O Thou that dwell'st in the heavens high, 
    Above yon stars, and within yon sky,
    Where the dazzling fields never needed light, 
    Of the sun by day, nor the moon by night!

    2. Tho’ shining myriads around Thee stand,
    For the sake of Him at Thy right hand;
    O think of those that cost Him dear,
    Still left’mid death and darkness here!

    3. Our night is dreary, and dim our day;
    And if Thou turnest Thy face away,
    We are sinful, feeble, and helpless dust,
    We have none to look to, and none to trust.

    4. The pow’rs of darkness are all abroad,
    They ask no Saviour, they seek no God; 
    And us they scorn who await the day— 
    Then turn not Thou Thy face away!

    5. A life of scorn for us Thou didst lead,
    And in the grave laid’st Thy blessed head; 
    Then grant us grace, undauntedly
    To lay down life and all for Thee.

    6. Thine aid, O mighty One, we crave,
    Nor shortened is Thine arm to save,
    Afar from Thee we now sojourn—
    Return to us, O Lord, re turn!

    In Thy glory, come again.

    Where the Lord of Glory la y;
    Jesus is not there, but risen,
    And has borne our sins away,
    It is finish’d!
    Captive leads captivity.

    2. Could not all our sins retain Him, 
    Prison’d in the guarded cave?

    By His cross He spoil’d the grave: 
    Lo! H e’s risen!

    Jesus, Who died and rose again,
    The holy, harmless, undefil’d,
    Within the Holiest is gone,

    2. The Saviour died upon the tree,
    And sank for us beneath the flood; 
    Our sins are drown’d as in a sea 
    Of love, of sorrow, and of blood! 
    Perfect in Jesu’s sacrifice,
    Her foes the blameless church defies.

    3. Then, God, we give Thee of Thine own,
    Hearts by Thy Jesu’s cross subdued, 
    Polluted once, and hearts of stone,
    But by Thy Spirit now renew’d;373—374

    2. Come, behold Him, our forerunner,
    Gone within the holy place,
    Heaven itself the holy temple,
    There He sees the Father’s face.

    3. As the eye of God the Father
    Ever loves on Christ to rest;
    So, by God, are all His members

    Nor shall we from those fountains stray, 
    Whence living waters ceaseless flow.

    The Son of God is slain; 
    Jehovah’s mercy-seat appears,
    The vail is rent in twain.

    2. Now truth and mercy meet
    In holy unity,
    Since Jesu’s blood the ransom is, 
    That sets the pris’ner free.

    3. Within the holy place
    Made by Jehovah’s hands,
    There Jesus, Who was crucified, 
    In kingly priesthood stands.

    4. There He in heaven appears,

    Seated on the throne of God;
    While the heav’nly hosts before Thee, 
    Gladly sing Thy praise aloud.
    “Thou art worthy!
    We were ransom’d by Thy blood.”

    2. Saviour! though the world despis’d Thee,
    Though Thou here wast crucified,
    Yet the Father’s glory rais’d Thee,
    Lord of all creation wide;
    “Thou art worthy!
    We shall live, for Thou hast died.”

    3. And though here on earth rejected,
    ’Tis but fellowship with Thee,
    What besides could be expected,
    Than like Thee our Lord to be?
    “Thou art worthy!
    Thou from earth hast set us free.”

    4. Haste the day of Thy returning,
    With Thy ransom’d church to reign;
    Then shall end our days of mourning, 
    We shall sing with rapture then,
    “Thou art worthy! ”
    “Come, Lord Jesus, Come. Amen 1”

    1. Father! we, Thy children, bless Thee,
    For Thy love on us bestow’d,
    As our Father we address Thee,
    Call’d to be the sons of God. 
    Wondrous was Thy love in giving 
    Jesus for our sins to die,
    Wondrous was His grace in leaving,
    For our sakes, His home on high.

    2. Now the sprinkled blood has freed us.
    On we go toward our rest,
    Through the desert Thou dost lead us, 
    With Thy constant favour blest:
    By Thy truth and Spirit guiding,
    Earnest He of what’s to come,
    And with daily food providing,
    Thou dost lead Thy children home.

    3. Though our pilgrimage be dreary,
    This is not our resting-place;377
    Shall we of the way be weary,
    When we see our Master’s face? 
    Now, by faith anticipating,
    In this hope our souls rejoice,
    We, His promised advent waiting, 
    Soon shall hear His welcome voice.

    4. Father, O how vast the blessing,
    When Thy Son returns again!
    Then Thy saints, their rest possessing, 
    O’er the earth with Him shall reign 
    For the fathers’ sakes beloved,
    Israel, in Thy grace restor’d,
    Shall on earth, the curse removed,
    Be the people of the Lord.

    5. Then shall countless myriads, wearing
    Robes made white in Jesu’s blood, 
    Palms (like rested pilgrims) bearing, 
    Stand around the throne of God: — 
    These, redeem’d from every nation, 
    Shall in triumph bless Thy name; 
    Every voice shall cry “Salvation,
    To our God, and to the Lamb!"

    All I may think, or do, or say ;
    That all my powers, with all their might, 
    For Thy sole glory may unite.

    4. Heaven, Lord, is there where’er Thou art; 
    0 never then from me depart;
    For to my soul ’twere hell, to be 
    But for one moment void of Thee.

    1. Lord o f my life, 0 may Thy praise
    Employ my noblest pow’r s ;
    Whose goodness lengthens out my days,
    And fills the circling hours.

    2. Preserv’d by Thine almighty arm,
    I pass’d the shades of night,
    Serene, and safe from every harm,
    And see returning light.

    3. While many spent the night in sighs,
    And restless pains and woes;
    In gentle sleep I clos’d mine eyes,
    And undisturb’d repose.

    4. When sleep, death’s semblance, o’er me spread
    And I unconscious lay,
    Thy watchful care was round my bed,
    To guard my feeble clay.

    5. 0 let the same almighty care
    My waking hours attend ;
    From every danger, every snare,
    My trembling steps defend.

    6. Smile on the minutes as they roll,
    And guide my future days ;
    And let Thy goodness fill my soul 
    With gratitude and praise.

    Again we bow the knee.

    2. 0  may the beams of truth divine,
    With pure convincing light,
    In all our understandings shine,
    And clear our mental sight.

    3. Preserve us, Lord, throughout the day,
    And guide us by Thine arm ;
    For they are safe, and only they,
    Whom Thou dost keep from harm.

    4. Let all our words and all our ways
    Declare that we are Thine;
    That so the light of truth and grace 
    Before the wrorld may shine.

    5. Nor let us turn away from Thee;
    Dear Saviour, hold us fast,

    1. In sleep’s serene oblivion laid,
    I safely pass’d the silent night;
    Again I see the breaking shade,
    I drink again the morning light.

    2. Refresh’d, I bless the waking hour,
    Once more, with awe, rejoice to be;
    My conscious soul resumes her power, 
    And springs, my Saviour God, to Thee !

    3. 0 guide me through the various maze, 
    Which I and Thine are forced to tread ; 
    And spread Thy shield’s protecting blaze, 
    Where dangers press around my head.

    Keep me, 0 keep me, King of kings, 
    Under Thine own Almighty wings.

    2. Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
    The ills that I this day have done;
    That with the world, myself, and Thee,
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

    3. 0 may my soul on Thee repose,
    And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close; 
    Sleep, that may me more active make,
    To serve my God when I awake.

    4. Should death itself my sleep invade,
    Why should I be of death afraid ? 
    Protected by Thy saving arm,
    Tho’ death may strike, it cannot harm.


    5. For death is life, and labour rest,
    When with Thy gracious presence blest; 
    Then welcome sleep or death to me,
    I’m still secure, for still with Thee.

    6. Praise God, from whom all blessings flow, 
    Praise Him, all creatures here below:

    1. Now Father, let our evening songs
    Like holy incense rise;
    And let the off’rings of our tongues 
    Be holy sacrifice.

    2. Through all the dangers of the day
    Thyself for us hast car’d ;
    And still to drive our wants away,
    Thy mercy stands prepar’d.

    3. Perpetual blessings from above
    Encompass us around;
    But a h! how few returns of love 
    Hath our Redeemer found.

    4. What have we done for Him Who died
    To save our sinful souls ?
    Alas ! our sins are multiplied,
    Fast as each minute rolls.


    5. Yet with these sin-stain’d lives of ours, 
    Lord, to Thy blood we flee;
    And yield them up with all their powers, 
    To be renew’d by Thee.

    Exceed my highest praise.

    2. What shall I render for the care
    Which me this day has kept?
    A thankful heart, though no return,
    Thy grace will still accept.

    3. The sins and follies, holy God,
    Which 1 this day have done,
    I would confess with grief; and pray 
    For pardon through Thy Son.

    4. Much of my precious time I’ve lost:

    1. Through the day Thy love has spar’d us, 
    Wearied now we part for rest; 
    Throughthe silent watches guard us,
    Let no foe our peace molest:
    Jesus ! Thou our guardian be,
    Sweet it is to trust in Thee.

    2. Pilgrims here on earth, and strangers, 
    Dwelling in the midst of foes;

    Safely keep both us and ours,

    We are bold, in Thee confiding,
    Safe beneath Thy shade abiding.

    2. Since we cannot tell to-day
    What to-morrow’s dawn may bring; 
    Saviour, draw our hearts away 
    Far from ev’ry earthly thing:
    Make us, in Thy service steady, 
    Always for Thy coming ready.

    Those strange mysterious sounds did hear, 
    “ The Lord is risen."12

    2. The holy Captive’s bonds are riven,
    To Him the keys of death are given,
    Be glad, O earth, and shout, 0 heaven!
    “ The Lord is risen.”

    3. Shall this triumphant theme inspire 
    The angel’s song, the seraph’s lyre,
    And saints not sing with such a choir,
    “ The Lord is risen” ?

    4. For not for them His life He gave;
    He did not die their souls to save;
    It is for man that from the grave
    “ The Lord is risen.”

    5. For man He left His glorious throne,
    For man to death’s dark realm went down 
    And now to heaven for man alone
    “ The Lord is risen! ”

    Thus, Lord, while we remember Thee, 
    We bless’d and patient grow;
    And learn by hymns of praise to be 
    Triumphant here below.

    2. On this glad day a brighter scene
    Of glory was display’d,
    By God, the eternal Word, than when 
    This universe was made:
    For then He rose, the church Who bought 
    With grief and pain extreme:
    ’Twas great to speak a world from nought; 
    ’Twas greater to redeem.

    ’Twas thus He paid our debt, and thus 
    He saved our souls from hell.

    3. We hail the day, the week’s first day,
    The day the Saviour rose:
    The Lord, He bore our sins away ; 
    From this our comfort flows.

    4. From this there flows a rich supply
    Of all we can require;
    Tis pardon, peace, and holy joy— 
    What more can we desire ?

    5. What more, but that we may sustain
    Untir’d the holy strife ;
    And then, with all the victors, gain 
    A crown, the crown of life?
 
 

## 394.  The day that Jesus rose should be.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wTW74H00we%2DZtvfrtXYfY46VXPvQ2xpb/edit?mode=html)



    1. T h e day th at Jesus rose should be
    Remember’d by His friends;
    Upon His rising, all agree,
    Their hope of heaven depends.

    2. If Jesus rose not from the dead,
    His people’s hope is vain ;
    He then would have no power to save, 
    Nor should they live again.

    3. But now is Jesus ris’n indeed,
    And He “ the first-fruits” is ;
    The first-fruits of the ransom’d seed, 
    Of those He claims as His.

    4. As He is ris’n, so they shall rise;
    As He lives, so shall they:
    A dwelling theirs beyond the skies, 
    And theirs a glorious day.
    b The hope that Jesus shall appear, 
    And take His saints to heav’n,
    To dwell with Him for ever there; 
    This hope to saints is giv’n.

    1. On this day, the first of seven, 
    Sinners we, through grace forgiven, 
    Come before the God of heaven:
    Saviour, let us hear Thy voice.

    2. From our hearts remove all sadness; 
    Fill us, Lord, with holy gladness:
    All the worldling’s mirth is madness;
    But Thy people should rejoice.

    3. Of Thy love for ever tasting,
    Theirs are pleasures everlasting; 
    Theirs a treasure never wasting,
    Which nor moth nor rust destroys.

    4. Trusting to Thy faithful promise,
    Joy and gladness well become us:
    Who shall wrest the blessing from us,
    Who that force or guile employs ?

    1. B lessed day, the first of sev’n !
    ’Tis the day when Jesus rose;
    And, with Him, the heirs of heav’n: 
    Blessed day, when saints repose!

    2. Blessed day, when Christians meet,
    Breaking bread in peace and love, 
    Sitting at the Saviour’s feet, 
    Drawing comforts from above!

    3. Jesus died, and rose again;
    Jesus took His place above: 
    Heaven was fill’d with rapture then ; 
    All was wonder, joy, and love.

    4. Sing we then of Him Who died,
    Him Who rose again and lives; 
    Sing of Jesus glorified,
    Him Who all our sin forgives;

    5. Him Who saves us by His grace,
    Keeps us till the final day;
    Gives us then a glorious place:
    Sing of Him, for well we may.

    Lord, our song ascends to Thee, 
    While we gladly bow the knee.

    2. For the mercies of this day,
    For refreshment on our way,
    Thanks to Thee alone be given,
    Lord of earth and God of heaven.

    3. Cold our services have been, 
    Mingled every prayer with sin ;
    But Thou canst and dost forgive; 
    For by grace alone we live.

    4. Whilst this thorny path we tread, 
    May Thy love our footsteps lead;

    1. I rest in Christ the Son of God,

    By faith I flee to Jesu’s cross,
    My covert from the storm.

    2. At peace with God, no ills I dread,

    The Lord is risen, His precious blood

    3. Jesus put all my sins away
    When bruised to make me whole:
    Who shall accuse or who condemn 
    My blameless ransom’d soul ?

    4. O thou destroyer, see the blood

    1. Of t  we, alas! forget the love
    Of Him Who bought us with His blood; 
    Who now, as our High Priest above,
    E’er intercedes for us with God.

    2. Oft we forget the woe, the pain,
    The bloody sweat, th’ accursed tree,
    The w rath His soul did once sustain,
    From sin and death to set us free.

    3. Oft we forget that, strangers here,
    This world is not our rest or home;
    That, waiting till our Lord appear, .
    Our hearts should cry, “ Come, Saviour, 
    come!”

    4. Oft we forget that we are one
    With every saint that loves His nam e; 
    United to Him on the throne—
    Our life, our hope, our Lord, the same.

    5. O, then, what love is here display’d !
    That Jesus did this feast provide 
    The very night He was betray’d,
    The very night before He died.

    6. Here, in the broken bread and wine,
    We hear Him say, “ Remember me .
    “ I gave My life to ransom thine, _
    “ I bore thy curse to set thee free.

    7. Lord, we are Thine—we praise Thy love— 
    One with Thy saints, all one in Thee;
    We would, until we meet above,
    In all our ways, remember Thee.

    8. “For 1 have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night  in which he was betrayed, took bread: And, when he had 
    given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my  body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance23
    l o r d ’ s  s u p p e r . of me After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in 
    my blood : this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remem- brance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and 
    drink this cup, y e do shew the Lord’s death till he come. - 1 Cor. xi. 23-26.

    We shew forth our Saviour’s death;

    How His body God did bruise.

    4. While by faith we drink the wine,
    Of His blood we see the sign;
    Precious blood ! so freely spilt,
    To redeem our souls from guilt.

    5. Lord, we thus remember Thee;

    Hence the old unhallow’d leav’n.

    2. Blessed is the name we think of,
    When together breaking bread; 
    Blessed is the cup we drink of,
    Type of blood, for sinners shed: 
    Happy are we,
    Quicken’d by the Lord, and fed.

    3. Let us walk in love, united
    To our living Head above,
    Let us sing His praise delighted,
    Sing the praise of Him we love: 
    Saviour, bless us!
    Let us all Thy goodness prove.

    4. Standing in the Saviour’s merit,
    We have peace, and we are blest; 
    Taught and guided by the Spirit,
    We have hope of future rest:
    This we wait for,
    And the Saviour’s time is best.
 
 

## 419.  While we partake the bread and wine
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F%2Dj2wYiSNfGE%2Dwn80HmPF1uRoMrqFC%2D1/edit?mode=html)



    1. W h i l e  we partake the bread and w ine,
    As emblems of Thy death,
    Lord, raise each soul above the sign, 
    To feast on Thee by faith.

    2. We do not come as strangers, Lord,
    Who only see the sign,
    l o r d ’ s  s u p p e r .
    But, as the objects of Thy love, 
    As sav’d by love divine.
 
 

## 420.  O the matchless love of God
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F_%2DaWKH7k%2DpabUdlxNPrV9ODXsi7%2Ds11/edit?mode=html)



    1. O t h e  matchless love of God;
    He hath bought the church with blood: 
    Jesus, her exalted Head,
    For her sigh’d, and groan’d, and bled.

    2. She deserv’d eternal pain,
    But the Lamb for her was slain;
    He endur’d the wrath of heav’n 
    That her sins might be forgiv’n.

    3. He invites us to this feast;
    Bids our souls His glories taste;
    And with pleasure keep in view,
    What He once for us went through.

    4. Hear Him speak, ye saved few 
    For this word is sent to you;
    You, the objects of His choice,
    Listen to the Saviour’s voice:

    5. “ This, my body is, and blood;
    Take, receive it, as your food;
    But, as oft as this ye do,
    Keep your m a rtyr’d Lord in view.

    6. “ View Him in the church’s place, 
    Overwhelm’d in deep disgrace: 
    Plung’d in horror’s dreadful flood, 
    Bearing all the wrath of God.

    7. “ Risen now, with wonder tell,
    He has vanquish’d death and hell: 
    Cancell’d all your sins with blood,
    And will bring you home to God.”

    8. Shortly He Himself will come,
    And will raise us to His throne;
    Where His glories He’ll display,
    Through a long and endless day.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DORq_fmRKb5vP71PgRC6Ka5N9fh8h71P/edit?mode=html)



    1. T he s e  emblems of th e Saviour’s love,
    By faith may we receive;
    And with a solemn pleasure prove,
    That we in Him believe.

    2. No goodness of our own we bring;
    For we are vile and base;
    Christ is our all, of Christ we sing,
    And wait to see His face.

    3. As beggars poor, and blind, and mean,
    We rest on Christ alone:
    Thanks to the Lamb that once was slain— 
    The Lamb that did atone.

    4. Our sins are His (O bless His name!)
    His righteousness is our’s ;
    He saves from Satan, wrath, and sin,
    And all their frightful powers.

    5. Then let us each, with heart and tongue,
    Sing, “ Worthy is the Lamb !”
    To Him alone the praise belongs,
    And we ’ll adore His name.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWKF%2DGaHjGCSIxx%2Dlf1Je7Rfuu_iW7xd/edit?mode=html)



    1. Se e ! the Father’s hand is spreading
    Manna in the wilderness:
    See! the Holy Ghost is shedding 
    Love, and joy, and peacefulness:
    To Himself, the lost, the vile—
    God in Christ doth reconcile.

    2. Till we knew this cup of blessing,
    Nothing for our souls sufficed:
    Here we rest, by faith possessing 
    Pardon through the blood of Christ. 
    Now we thirst for nought beside:
    All our wants are satisfied.

    3. While we share in sweet communion,
    While on Christ our souls are fed, 
    Here the world may see our union, 
    One the body—one the bread.
    Now we seek for nought beside, 
    Richly all our need supplied.

    4. In the heav’ns our Lord is seated,
    And His church is in Him there; 
    When on earth the Bride’s completed, 
    All His glory we shall share:
    But till He, our life, appear,
    Nought but suffering know we here.
 
 

## 423.  'Simply as disciples gather''d'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DowEGVBRcfqt4vArXbVXQ1HSCroYKXyt/edit?mode=html)



    “ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the 
    communion (lit. fellowship) of the blood of Christ ? 
    The bread which we break, is it not the communion 
    (lit. fellowship) of the body of Christ? For we,being many, are one bread, and one body; for we all are 
    partakers of that one bread.”

    1. Sim p l y as disciples ga th er’d
    In His name—The Lord is here;
    And in Him our all is treasur’d,
    Him we all in common share.

    2. Not to teach or hear assembling,
    But to do our Master’s will;
    Thus to Jesu’s self resembling,
    God Himself shall cheer us still.

    3. Yea, this table of communion,
    Whither by the Lord we ’re led,
    Sweetly speaks our blessed union,
    One the body—one the bread.

    4.  And as gather’d round the table,
    We the wine together sup,
    We have joy, both sure and stable,
    One the blessing—one the cup.

    5. In the Spirit one for ever,
    One with Christ, and one with God;
    One we are, and nought can sever 
    Us who are redeem’d with blood.

    6. By our sins His blood was spilled.
    Pardon hence through love Divine!
    And, through Him the law fulfilled,
    In His righteousness we shine.

    7. Till He comes we still are thinking ^
    That “ we wait for Him to come,”
    And (with us the new wine drinking)
    Take us to His royal home.
 
 

## 424.  'Thy broken body, gracious Lord!'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWWBgnAw0eMa7eIMpfHswUCKUoL8PQKH/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thy broken body, gracious Lord!
    Is shadow’d by this broken bread,
    The wine which in this cup is pour’d 
    Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.

    2. And while we meet together thus,
    We shew that we are one in Thee,
    Thy precious blood was shed for us,
    Thy death, 0 Lord, has set us free.

    3. Brethren in Thee, in union sweet,
    (For ever be thy grace ador’d),
    ’Tis in Thy name, that now we meet,
    And know Thou’rt with us, gracious Lord.

    4. We have one hope—that Thou wilt come,
    Thee in the air we wait to see,
    When Thou wilt take Thy people home,
    And wre shall ever reign with Thee.
 
 

## 425.  With Jesus in our midst
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKY4qpVxALgY74aqv2iEYEYtLRjeES0Y/edit?mode=html)



    1. With Jesus in our midst
    We gather round the board; 
    Though many, we are one in Christ, 
    One body in the Lord.

    2. Our sins were laid on Him
    When bruis’d on Calvary;
    With Christ we died and rose again, 
    And sit with Him on high.

    3. Faith eats the bread of life,
    And drinks the living wine; 
    Thus we in love together knit,
    On Jesus’ breast recline.

    4.  Soon shall the night be gone,
    And we with Jesus reign;
    The marriage supper of the Lamb 
    Shall banish ev’ry pain.
 
 

## 426.  'Jesus, hail! exalted Saviour.'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dv0MiSG9G3qmjL3EbqZmi6iALQDqiKsj/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, hail! exalted Saviour,
    We adore Thy matchless grace;
    Thou didst bear our misbehaviour, 
    Suff’ring in our room and place ;
    Wrath and terror 
    Sunk Thy soul in deep disgrace.

    2. For us Thou didst bear the horrors
    Of the judgment unto blood;
    Who can understand the sorrows 
    Of Thy soul in wrath’s deep flood.
    Fearful anguish!
    Only fully known to God.

    3. Yet, through grace, we know in measure,
    What Thy love for us hath done,
    And we hope, through Thy good pleasure, 
    To behold Thee on Thy throne,
    And for ever,
    Sing the vict’ries Thou hast won.

    4. By Thy Spirit’s operation,
    Into death, Thy death, baptiz’d,
    Risen with Thee, Thy Salvation 
    Is by us no more despis’d:
    Therefore baptism 
    Must by us be dearly priz’d.

    1. P recious Jesus! here we are 
    Come to witness and declare
    We are Thine, redeem’d with blood,
    Call’d and prov’d the sons of God.

    2. Wrath and vengeance on Thee fell,
    That we might be sav’d from hell: ’
    And shall we disdain to own
    What Thou hast to us made known ?

    3. Jesus, ere He gave His blood,
    Was immers’d in Jordan’s flood;
    There, and in that way, to show 
    All He had to undergo.

    4. In the watery grave we see,
    Looking through it, Lord, to Thee,
    Jesus, overwhelm’d in blood,
    Sunk in wrath’s tremendous flood,

    5. Thanks, eternal thanks to Thee,
    That we thus can plainly seeBAPTISM.
    Mercy, truth, and justice meet, 
    All to make Thy bride complete.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DJIlVstHlcvP3MkQWjiYT5DBSofivVmh/edit?mode=html)



    1. As sinners sav’d by grace,
    And made alive to God,
    Thy righteousness we would embrace,
    And tread the heav’nly road.

    2. Thy wisdom did ordain
    This solemn rite to show 
    How Thou wast plung’d in wrath and pain, 
    To save our souls from woe.

    3.  We come Thy name to own,
    And solemnly confess,
    Thou art our Life, our Joy, our Crown, 
    Our Strength and Righteousness.
 
 

## 429.  One baptism we own.
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D6yC20jOGaC6hECS4HUW4u5qkuOTrIiJ/edit?mode=html)



    1. O ne baptism  we own,
    A sacred, solemn sign 
    Of what the Saviour’s undergone, 
    To wash away our sin.

    2. His overwhelming pain,
    And burial w e see;
    His rising from the grave again, 
    To set His members free.

    3. He hid our guilt from view,
    And buried all our sin;
    And He ordained this way to show 
    That we are one with Him.

    4. Then here by faith we view,
    That Christians all are dead 
    To Satan, sin, and Moses too, 
    Through Christ their living Head.

    5. And rising from the flood
    Doth solemnly maintain 
    Their life is hid with Christ in God, 
    And they shall with Him reign.

    1. F ob us Jesus was b a p tiz ’d 
    For us He was ag on iz’d ;
    Mighty vengeance, like a flood, 
    Overwhelm’d the Lamb of God.

    2. Come, ye saints, with wonder view 
    What the Lord has done for you;
    View the mighty waters roll,
    Breaking in upon His soul.

    3. View the swelling floods of wrath 
    Sinking Jesus into death;
    Grief Him cover’d like a grave,
    When He died your souls to save.

    4. This was baptism indeed;
    Well might mountains shake with dread; 
    Baptism serves in type to show,
    What our Lord did undergo.5 Sons of God, lift up your eyes; 
    See the martyr’d Saviour rise;
    He has conquer’d death and hell; 
    With Him you shall ever dwell.

    1. Children of God! in all your need,
    Remember Him Who died for you;
    Ye suppliants ! think, whene’er ye plead, 
    The Lord of Love is pleading too.

    2. Nor pleads in vain—the Father hears
    The voice of His beloved Son,
    ’Tis music in Jehovah’s ears:
    He pleads ; and lo, the suit is won.

    3.  “ Father, forgive them!” Jesus cried,
    When bleeding on the cursed tree—
    “ Bless, bless them, Lord, for this I died!” 
    Is now His all-prevailing plea.

    4.  Come, brethren, then, our feeblest pray’r,
    Perfum’d with Jesu’s blessed name,
    Is heard on high, is treasur’d there,
    And all that heav’n can give may claim.

    5.  From everlasting we are His,
    In love’s eternal counsel giv’n ;
    And He Himself our portion is,
    The glory of our promis’d heav’n.

    1. We bless Thee, Lord, that we have met 
    Once more before Thy mercy-seat, 
    Thy ransom’d family, to raise
    In Jesu’s name our song of praise.

    2. And now Thy blessing we implore,
    To guard and keep us evermore;
    Into Thine hand our souls commend, 
    To guide, and strengthen, and defend.

    3. Through all the dangers of the night 
    Through the temptations of the light,PARTING.
    Through every snare, from every ill,
    Thou, Lord, shalt be our Saviour still.

    4. Once more, for all Thy love hath done, 
    Thy mercies past, or yet unknown ;
    For all Thy goodness, gracious Lord,
    For ever be Thy name ador’d !

    We’ll glory and boast evermore.

    1. J esus, m y sorrow lies too deep
    For human ministry;
    It knows not how to tell itself 
    To any but to Thee.

    2. Thou dost remember still, amid
    The glories of God’s throne,
    The sorrows of mortality,
    For they were once Thine own.

    3. Yes, for as if Thou would’st be God,
    E’en in Thy misery,
    There’s been no sorrow but Thine own 
    Untouch’d by sympathy.

    4. Jesus, my fainting spirit brings
    It’s Tearfulness to Thee,
    Thine eye at least can penetrate 
    The clouded mystery.

    5. And is it not enough, enough,
    This holy sympathy ?
    There is no sorrow e’er so deep 
    But I may bring to Thee.

    1. It is enough—my precious Lord,
    Thy tender sympathy—
    My ev’ry sin and sorrow can 
    Devolve itself on Thee.

    2. As God, Thou graspedst e’en the whole
    Of human misery,
    Thine own alone lay desolate,
    That Thou mightst pitied be.p r a y e r .

    3. Thy risen life but whets Thee more
    For kindly sympathy,
    Thy love unhinder’d rests upon 
    Each bruised “ Branch in Thee.”

    4. Jesus, Thou hast avail’d to probe
    My deepest malady,
    It freely flows, more freely finds 
    Thy gracious remedy.
 
 

## 453.  'Lord! let my heart still turn to Thee'
[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BX9Y5uErzYOSe0USdUA_7BVvx3ApP9lD/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lord ! let my heart still turn to Thee,
    In all my hours of waking thought!
    Nor let this heart e’er wish to flee,
    To think, or feel, where thou art not!

    2. In every hour of pain or woe,
    When nought on earth this heart can cheer, 
    When sighs will burst, and tears will flow,
    Lord, hush the sigh, and chase the tear!

    3. In every dream of earthly bliss,
    Do Thou, dear Saviour, present be!
    Nor let me dream of happiness 
    On earth, without the thought of Thee!

    4. To my last lingering thought at night,
    Do Thou, Lord Jesus, still be near,
    And ere the dawn of opening light,
    In still small accents wake mine ear!

    5. Whene’er I read Thy sacred word,
    Bright on the page in glory shine!
    And let me say, *“This precious Lord 
    In all His full salvation's mine.”*

    6. And ==when before the throne I kneel==,
    Hear from that throne of grace my prayer; 
    And let each hope of heaven I feel,
    Burn with the thought to meet Thee there.

    7. Thus teach me, Lord, to look to Thee,
    In ev’ry hour of waking thought,
    Nor let me ever wish to be,
    To think or feel where Thou art not! AMEN.
